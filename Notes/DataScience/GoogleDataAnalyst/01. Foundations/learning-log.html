<em>What are some considerations or preferences you want to keep in mind when making a decision?</em> 
</p>

<p>
First of all you have to look at the problem objectively, without any bias towards the probable solution, as to avoid jumping to less efficient solutions. Also you may want to summarize each solution/option to its core idea, so it will be easier to pick up the advantages and disadvantages 
</p>

<p>
<em>What kind of information or data do you have access to that will influence your decision?</em> 
</p>

<p>
I may have a journal where I introduce the number of books a read (as in I registry each book I have read as an entry)
</p>

<p>
<em>Are there any other things you might want to track associated with this decision?</em> 
</p>

<p>
Other characteristics of the books, other than the time when they were finished may help analyze a trend: the time it took for me to read it, the subject of the book, the language of the book, etc.

<p>
Consider how the data analysts at Google used the data analysis process to break down their analysis project:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
The analysts asked questions to define both the issue to be solved and what would equal a successful result.

</li><li>
Next, they prepared by building a timeline and collecting data with employee surveys, which should be inclusive.

</li><li>
They processed the data by cleaning it to make sure it was complete, correct, relevant, and free of errors and outliers.

</li><li>
They analyzed the clean employee survey data. Then the analysts shared their findings and recommendations with team leaders. Afterward, leadership acted on the results and focused on improving key areas.

</li></ul>
<div id="Learning Log-Consider how data analysts approach tasks-Reflection"><h3 id="Reflection" class="header"><a href="#Learning Log-Consider how data analysts approach tasks-Reflection">Reflection</a></h3></div>

<p>
Write 2-3 sentences in response to each of the questions below
</p>

<p>
<em>Did the details of the case study help to change the way you think about data analysis? Why or why not??</em> 
</p>

<p>
Even though I am familiar with the process and steps one has to follow to perform data analysis, I did not really think about the <span id="Learning Log-Consider how data analysts approach tasks-Reflection-asking"></span><strong id="asking">asking</strong> part of it, or the showing your results in a way everybody can understand. 
</p>

<p>
<em>Did you find anything surprising about the way the data analysts approached their task?</em> 
</p>

<p>
Not surprising, every step that was laid out seems to make sense. Also coming from a CS background all the workflow of asking questions to define the needs of the client is very similar.
</p>

<p>
<em>What else would you like to learn about data analysis?</em> I would like to know how to extract/find trends in data, be able to turn a heap of information to something useful

Create a list exploring an area of your daily life and include details, such as the date, time, cost, quantity, size, etc:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
28/03 - Slept 6 hours, moderately well rested 

</li><li>
29/03 - Slept 7 hours, slightly tired

<p>
<em>Are there any trends you noticed in your behavior?</em>
</p>

<p>
Whenever something stressful comes up I get very little sleep. Also because I, one, finished a math book (so I searched a for a new resource to learn) and, two, got a new job (the resource I chose was this one) I suddenly was trying to do everything in a frenzy, and so stayed up until way later than usual. 
</p>

<p>
<em>Are there factors that influence your decision-making?</em>
</p>

<p>
I am used to having 2 to 3 hours free before going to sleep, so if I do not manage to have enough time to have that amount of hours, I will just stay up until later, and kind of make the free time even longer because of the anxiety of knowing I should go to sleep.
</p>

<p>
<em>Is there anything you identified that might influence your future behavior?</em>
</p>

<p>
I will sleep better if I can manage better my time (not cram as many tasks a day) and reduce my anxiety whenever a slight change occurs in my life.

</li></ul>
<p>
You will put an X in the column that you think best describes your current level with each aspect. The three ratings are:
</p>

<p>
<em>What do you notice about the ratings you gave yourself in each area? How did you rate yourself in the areas that appeal to you most?</em>
</p>

<p>
Generally speaking I am most proficient at the one that I have been trained academically in, and are more technical. The ones that require soft skills, I am worse at.
</p>

<p>
<em>If you are asked to rate your experience level in these areas again in a week, what do you think the ratings will be, and why do you think that?</em>
</p>

<p>
I think most of them will stay the same, but maybe I will become better in data strategy with the help of this course.
</p>

<p>
<em>How do you plan on developing these skills from now on?</em>
</p>

<p>
Well curiosity wise, I think the best way for me to go forward is to start projects of my own to see all the caveats a data analysis project can entail.
</p>

<p>
And when it comes to data strategy, my way of improving would be to understand better how to manage a project and also the different tools available to manage data.

<p>
In a new learning log entry, follow the instructions in the template, and add a table to organize your data. Then, write 3-5 sentences (60-100 words) on opportunities in your personal life or current job to organize data into tables.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
I could gather data about how many hours a day I am productive at my job

</li><li>
How many time I spend logging my work, instead of working

<p>
So far, you have planned a project, identified the data you need, and collected the data. Earlier in this course, you completed a learning log where you recorded some data from your daily life, then took the practical step of organizing it. Now, you’re ready for the most satisfying step of the data analysis project: visualizing your data! 
</p>

<p>
For this activity, you will move your data to a spreadsheet and bring it to life in a chart.

<ul>
<li>
<em>Which part(s) of the data analysis process did you enjoy the most? What did you enjoy about it?</em> 

</li></ul>
<p>
I enjoyed both the process, analysis and share steps because I feel it was the more interactive (as asking questions to oneself is not that fun), and allowed me to use the different tools discussed during the course.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<em>What were some of the key ideas you learned in this course?</em>

</li></ul>
<p>
The importance of following through each step to obtain a thorough and clear insight on the data you are analyzing. And also, the need of taking into account what the stakeholder hopes for when analyzing the data.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<em>Are there concepts or portions of the content that you would like to learn more about? If so, what are they? Which upcoming course do you think would teach you the most about this area?</em>

</li></ul>
<p>
I am so very excited about the visualization part of the data analysis. Because I have never dug deep enough into it, as I may have into the analysis or process step.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<em>Now that you've gained experience doing data analysis, how do you feel about becoming a data analyst? Have your feelings changed since you began this course? If so, how?</em>

</li></ul>
<p>
Well, I am mostly doing this course for fun. But sure being a data analyst still sounds exciting enough
