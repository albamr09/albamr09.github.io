    "body": " index search search back particle filters properties introduction initial probability resampling motion algorithm resampling example properties state space belief efficiency accuracy continuous multimodal Â  approximate introduction so, in a first instance, given a floor plan the robot has to perform global localization. that is, it does not know where it is, and it has to find out based on sensor measurements: the robot has range sensors (blue lines), which use sonar sensors (basically sound) to obtain the distance between the robot and the obstacles around it. it uses this sensors to determine a posterior distribution that models its position at a given time. each particle (dot) is a discrete guess whether the robot might be, and it holds the following information: x coordinate, y coordinate, and heading direction. then, the comprise of multiple of these guesses make up the representation for the posterior of the robot's location. so, initially the robot is completely uncertain as to where it is, which derives into a uniform distribution as to where it may be, and thus the particles are scattered all over the floor plan. however as time passes, the particle filter makes them survive according to how consistent these particles are compared to the sensor measurements: in summary, the particles guess where the robot might be moving and then the filter makes them \"survive\" (it does not discard them) using survival of the fittest. this latter statement means that those particles that are more consistent with the measurements are more likely to survive. initial probability at the start the robot only has the map of the room and no other knowledge, therefore there is equal probability that the robot is at any position in the map. hence, we create a set of \\(n\\) particles modeled after a uniform distribution. which means each particle is as likely to be chosen as any other. resampling at first, we have \\(n\\) particles scattered all over the map and most of them are wrong. so now, we can start removing some of the wrong guesses using measurements of the environment. and we do this by resampling \\(n\\) particles. this translates into, we choose \\(n\\) particles that represent the place we believe the robot is in. so, now the filter can go through each of our particles and determine what the measurement would be if our robot was in the position indicated by the particle. in other words, each particle has assigned an importance weight \\(w\\) that determines how likely the measurement \\(z\\) is given a concrete particle \\(p_i\\), (\\(p(z|p_i)\\)). so, given a total of \\(n\\) particles: \\begin{align} n \\begin{cases} p_1 & \\rightarrow w_1\\\\ p_2 & \\rightarrow w_2\\\\ \\vdots\\\\ p_n & \\rightarrow w_n\\\\ \\end{cases} \\end{align} let \\(w = \\sum_i w_i\\) be the sum of all the weights. we introduce a new variable \\(\\alpha\\) which represents the normalized weights: \\begin{align} n \\begin{cases} p_1 & \\rightarrow w_1 & \\rightarrow \\alpha_1 = \\frac{w_1}{w}\\\\ p_2 & \\rightarrow w_2 & \\rightarrow \\alpha_2 = \\frac{w_2}{w}\\\\ \\vdots\\\\ p_n & \\rightarrow w_n & \\rightarrow \\alpha_n = \\frac{w_n}{w}\\\\ \\end{cases} \\end{align} hence, \\(\\sum_i \\alpha_i = 1.0\\). so we have now defined a new probability distribution that describes more clearly the position of our robot because it takes into account our measurement. so, it's time for the resampling. we have to choose \\(n\\) particles from the overall set, where each particle \\(p_i\\) is chosen with probability \\(\\alpha_i\\): note we allow replacement, so we can draw multiple copies of the same particle \\(p_i\\). so what will happen is, the higher \\(\\alpha_i\\) the more likely it is that particle \\(p_i\\) is chosen multiple times, meanwhile the lower \\(\\alpha_i\\) is the more likely it is that it will not be chosen, and therefore simply removed from the set of particles. as you can see in the previous image, we have drawn three times \\(p_2\\), probably because the associated \\(\\alpha_2\\) was larger than the rest of the \\(\\alpha\\). therefore, the particles with a low importance weight will survive with a much lower rate than the ones with a higher importance weight. motion we also have to take into account that our particles cannot be static, but have to move with our robot. so whichever motion is applied to the robot should be applied to every single particle. once the motion is applied we obtain a measurement and perform resampling to choose those particles that are more likely to describe the real position of the robot. note that the motion will most probably contain noise, so we do not want to propagate the motion equally to each particle. what we would want is to add some gaussian noise to the particles to represent somewhat this uncertainty about the motion. algorithm measurement updates we compute the posterior over state distribution: \\begin{align} p(x|z) \\propto p(z|x)p(x) \\end{align} here: \\(p(x)\\) is the distribution over the set of particles. \\(p(z|x)\\) is the distribution that models the importance weights. and by resampling we obtain \\(p(x|z)\\), because we draw with probability equal to the importance weight a given particle. motion updates we compute the posterior over distribution one step later (after movement): \\begin{align} p(x^t) = \\sum p(x^t|x)p(x) \\end{align} where: \\(p(x)\\) is the distribution over the set of particles. and then, we sample from the sum. that is we generate a random particle \\(x^t\\) by applying the motion model \\(p(x^t|x)\\) to the particles \\(p(x)\\). resampling example suppose we have the following data: \\begin{align} n \\begin{cases} p_1 & \\rightarrow w_1 = 0.6 & \\rightarrow \\alpha_1 = \\frac{w_1}{w} = \\frac{0.6}{6.0} = 0.1\\\\ p_2 & \\rightarrow w_2 = 1.2 & \\rightarrow \\alpha_2 = \\frac{w_2}{w} = \\frac{1.2}{6.0} = 0.2\\\\ p_3 & \\rightarrow w_3 = 2.4 & \\rightarrow \\alpha_3 = \\frac{w_3}{w} = \\frac{2.4}{6.0} = 0.4\\\\ p_4 & \\rightarrow w_4 = 0.6 & \\rightarrow \\alpha_4 = \\frac{w_4}{w} = \\frac{0.6}{6.0} = 0.1\\\\ p_5 & \\rightarrow w_2 = 1.2 & \\rightarrow \\alpha_5 = \\frac{w_5}{w} = \\frac{1.2}{6.0} = 0.2\\\\ \\end{cases} \\end{align} then, the probability of never sampling \\(p_3\\) is given by the multiplication rule of probability: on the first draw: \\begin{align} p(\\bar{p_3}) = p(p_1) + p(p_2) + p(p_4) + p(p_5) = 0.6 \\end{align} because we allow for resampling, on the second draw: \\begin{align} 0.6 \\cdot p(\\bar{p_3}) = 0.6 \\cdot (p(p_1) + p(p_2) + p(p_4) + p(p_5)) = 0.6^2 \\end{align} thus, on the fifth and final draw: \\begin{align} 0.6^4 \\cdot p(\\bar{p_3}) = 0.6^4 \\cdot (p(p_1) + p(p_2) + p(p_4) + p(p_5)) = 0.6^5 = 0.0777 \\end{align} however, the probabily of never drawing \\(p_1\\) equals: \\begin{align} p(\\bar{p_1}) = 0.9 ^ 5 = 0.59 \\end{align} therefore, the particles with a low importance weight will survive with a much lower rate than the ones with a higher importance weight. $(\"pre\").each(function (index, item) { $(item).html(\"<code>\" + $(item).html() + \"</code>\"); }); hljs.highlightall();

localization algorithm probability given by belief suppose every place in the world is modeled after an uniform probability distribution, then every cell the robot has the same probability. probability after sense now suppose the robot is able to sense a color, and each cell has a different color assigned. let's assume the robot senses the color red, then the cells with this color assigned should have a higher probability. therefore we define two values, a hit value and a miss value. if the cell is red, then we multiply its probability by the hit value. if the cell is not red, then we multiply its probability by the miss value. note that the hit value is a big value, and the miss value is lower. thus the probability for miss cells is lower than the probability for hit cells. also, observe that a measurement refers to what the robot senses, that is, a green cell or a red cell. normalize the distribution now that we have altered the values of the probability distribution, it is likely that they do not sum up to one, which is a requirement to every probability function. therefore we need to normalize it. so what we would do is: compute the probabilities after the robot \"senses\" a measurement normalize these probabilities by dividing each probability by the total sum of all probabilities exact motion suppose we have a world made up of a grid with 5 cells with the following probabilities: [\\(\\frac{1}{3}\\)][\\(\\frac{1}{3}\\)][\\(\\frac{1}{9}\\)][\\(\\frac{1}{9}\\)][\\(\\frac{1}{3}\\)] we also know that with 100% probability the world moves to

b_n\\}\\) events in a sample space where \\(b\\) is pairwise disjoint, then: \\begin{align} p(a) = \\sum_n p(a \\cap b_n) \\end{align} then, by the conditional probability formula: \\begin{align} p(a) = \\sum_n p(a|b_n)p(b_n) \\end{align} so to apply this theorem what we do is sum the probabilities of ending up in cell \\(j\\) when we come from cell \\(i\\), which is expressed symbolically: \\begin{align} p(x_{j}) = \\sum_{i=1}^5 p(x_{j}|x_{i}) \\cdot p(x_{i}) = 1 \\cdot p({x_j}_{\\{j=(i+1)\\}}) \\end{align} because we know: \\begin{align} p(x_j|x_i) = \\begin{cases} 1, & j = i + 1 \\\\

& j = i + 3 \\\\ 0, & \\text{ otherwhise } \\end{cases} \\end{align} entropy the entropy will decrease after the measurement update (sense) step, and the entropy will increase after the movement step (move). in general, entropy represents the amount of uncertainty in a system. since the measurement update step decreases uncertainty, entropy will decrease. the movement step increases uncertainty, so entropy will increase after this step. the entropy formula for our case is the following: \\begin{align} entropy = \\sum_{i=1}^5(-p(x_i) \\cdot \\log(p(x_i))) \\end{align} bayes rule suppose: \\(x\\) represents the grid cell \\(z\\) represents the measurements then the bayes rule states: \\begin{align} p(x_i|z) = \\frac{p(z|x_i)p(x_i)}{p(z)} \\end{align} where: \\(p(x_i|z)\\) is called the posterior \\(p(z|x_i)\\) is called the likelihood \\(p(z)\\) is known as the evidence or marginal likelihood (that is, it marginalizes \\(z\\)). to compute \\(p(z)\\) we use the theorem of total probability: \\begin{align} p(z) = \\sum_{i=1}^n p(z|x_i)p(x_i) \\end{align} so, to compute \\(p(x_i|z)\\) we follow the steps: for each \\(x_i\\) compute the non-normalized posterior: \\(\\hat{p}(x_i|z) = p(z|x_i)p(x_i)\\) sum all non-normalized posteriors to obtain the evidence: \\(p(z) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\hat{p}(x_i|z)\\) for each \\(x_i\\) normalize the posterior with the evidence: \\(p(x_i|z) = \\frac{\\hat{p}(x_i|z)}{p(z)}\\) motion using total probability let's say we are at time \\(t\\), and \\(i\\) determines the cell, then the motion is expressed probabilistically as follows: \\begin{align} p(x_i^t) = \\sum_{j} p(x_i|x_j)p(x_j^{t-1}) \\end{align} if we break down this formula: \\(p(x_i|x_j)\\) is the probability that we end up in the cell \\(x_i\\) given we come from the cell \\(x_j\\) \\(p(x_j^{t-1})\\) is the probability of being in cell \\(x_j\\) at the previous time \\(p(x_i^t)\\) is the probability of being in cell \\(x_i\\) at time \\(t\\) summary belief represents where are possible places the robot might be, that is each cell has an associated probability value sense also known as the measurement update function. for each cell we compute the probability that the robot is in that cell, given a measurement sensed by the robot in the moment \\(t\\) (\\(p(x_k|z)\\), where \\(x_k\\) is the cell and \\(z\\) is the measurement). therefore, for each cell in the world we multiply the previous probability value (given by belief) and the probability that the robot moved to the given cell. for example, to satisfy the probability function properties, we need to normalize it, so it sums up to one. move it is a convolution, for each possible location, after the motion, we reverse engineered the situation and guessed where the world might have come from. so what we do is we compute the probability of each cell using the total probability theorem, so given a cell \\(x_k\\), we compute: \\begin{align} p(x_k) = \\sum_{l}p(x_k|x_l)p(x_l) \\end{align} where \\(p(x_k|x_l)\\) is the probabily that the robot moved to cell \\(x_k\\) from cell \\(x_l\\). usually what we do is stablish a motion using a vector (i.e. \\((0,1) \\in \\mathbb{r}^2\\) to indicate the robot moved one unit up in the two dimensional vector space). for example, this probability may refer to how likely it is that the robot moved to the exact cell, how likely it is that the robot moved to a cell \"beyond\" the goal or how likely it is that the robot moved to a cell that lies \"before\" the goal. so if we have these three probabilities, for each cell we sum the probabilities of the robot being in that cell taking into account the three scenarions: if the robot moved to cell \\(x_k\\) from cell \\(x_l\\), and that cell was the goal, then it moved to that cell with probability \\(p_{exact}\\) and maybe the robot moved to cell \\(x_k\\) from cell \\(x_i\\), however the goal was \\(x_{k+1}\\), then it moved to that cell with probability probability \\(p_{undershoot}\\) maybe the robot moved to cell \\(x_k\\) from cell \\(x_j\\), however the goal was \\(x_{k-1}\\), then it moved to that cell with probability probability \\(p_{overshoot}\\) suppose now that then only cells in the world are mentioned: \\(x_k, x_l, x_i, x_j\\). then for \\(x_k\\) we update the belief as follows: \\begin{align} p(x_k) =

    "body": " index search search back kalman filters markov model gaussian distribution measurement and motion motion step measurement step states predicting velocity high dimensional spaces put everything together algorithm this is a tracking technique. it is similar to the histogram localization we talked about previously, however there are some key differences: kalman filter maintains a continuous state (therefore uses a uni-modal distribution: probability density function only has one peak) histogram localization uses discrete state to represent the world (uses a multi-modal distribution: probability density function has multiple peaks) markov model in histogram localization we assigned a probability to each cell in the world: [\\(0.2\\)][\\(0.1\\)][\\(0.5\\)][\\(0.1\\)][\\(0.2\\)] what we did is we divided the continuous space into a finite number of cells, that approximates the posterior distribution (which is continuous: red line) by a histogram (blue bars) over the original distribution. however in kalman filters this distribution is given by a gaussian distribution. gaussian distribution a gaussian distribution is a continuous function which is described in \\(\\mathbb{r}\\) by the mean \\(\\mu\\) and the variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). the formula is the following: \\begin{align} f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} \\exp^{-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{(x-\\mu)}{\\sigma^2}} \\end{align} where \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}}\\) is a constant that normalizes \\(\\exp^{-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{(x-\\mu)}{\\sigma^2}}\\) remark the bigger the covariance \\(\\sigma^2\\) the wider the distribution, which means we are less certain of the state. if it is narrow, that means we are confident about our location. measurement and motion like with localization kalman filters operate within a cycle, that is, it iterates like so: motion (or prediction): where we predict the position of the car based on data we know. to perform this prediction we sum the location distribution and the distribution that describes the motion. measurement (or measurement update/correction): where we combine the prediction with the measurement made by the sensors. to perform this update we multiply the motion prediction with the distribution that describes the measurement. this is illustrated in the following image: here the predicted state estimate corresponds to the motion step, and the measurement distribution corresponds to the measurement. the result of the product between the two eausl the optimal state estimate. motion step suppose, at moment \\(t\\), your location is represented as follows: where: the blue gaussian distribution represents your best guess (prediction) at where your are at \\(t\\), and is characterized by \\((\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\) the green gaussian distribution represents the motion of \\(\\nu\\) units, which has its own uncertainty, and is characterized by \\((\\nu, r^2)\\) the red gaussian distribution represents you location at time \\(t+1\\) after the motion where this last distribution equals the sum of the other two distributions and is characterized by: \\begin{align} \\hat{\\mu} = \\mu + \\nu \\end{align} \\begin{align} \\hat{\\sigma}^2 = \\sigma^2 + r^2 \\end{align} so, basically the mean is shifted \\(\\nu\\) units and the covariance is made larger by summing \\(\\sigma^2\\) and \\(r^2\\), as a result of summing the distributions. motion noise note that the movement may not be certain, that is why we introduce some gaussian noise. this noise is drawn from a normal distribution where the variance is given by a co-variance matrix \\(q\\) (this matrix describes the uncertainty for the initial state). we define this noise as follows: \\begin{align} u \\sim \\mathcal{n}(0, q) \\end{align} measurement step as we have already said, the update is the result of multiplying the prediction distribution (after motion step), which was characterized in the previous section, by the measurement distribution. this would mean \"creating\" a new distribution that models the robot's current state. we now show how the multiplication of two distributions is performed: updating the mean we are going to show how to the mean is computed when multiplying two distributions. suppose the prior distribution is as follows: where the covariance is very large, so we are very uncertain about a location. and we recieve a measurement of the form: which is much more certain about the location. then the mean will shift accordingly (green line): updating the variance we are going to show how to the variance is computed when multiplying two distributions. so, after multiplying the prior and the measurement shown previously, the resulting gaussian y more certain than both of the prior and the measurement gaussians. that is the covariance of this new gaussian is smaller, so the more measurements we have the more certain the are. why does this happen? well, given these two distributions: where the first distribution is characterized by \\((\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\) and the second distribution is characterized by \\((\\nu, r^2)\\). the product of the two is a distribution characterized by \\((\\hat{\\mu}, \\hat{\\sigma}^2)\\), computed as follows: \\begin{align} \\hat{\\mu} = \\frac{r^2\\mu + \\sigma^2\\nu}{r^2 + \\sigma^2} \\end{align} observe, because \\(\\sigma^2 >> r^2\\) in our example, then \\(\\hat{\\mu}\\) will be closer to the second distribution's mean \\(\\nu\\). also: \\begin{align} \\hat{\\sigma}^2 = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{r^2} + \\frac{1}{\\sigma^2}} = \\frac{\\sigma^2 r^2}{\\sigma^2 + r^2} \\end{align} thus, the updated covariance is not affected by the means and will always be smaller than \\(\\sigma^2\\) and \\(r^2\\). we illustrate this is the following image, where the updated distribution is the one drawn in blue: note that the wider distribution represents the prior, the measurement represents the likelihood and the updated distribution represents the posterior. measurement noise however, note that the measurement might also be noisy. so we again introduce gaussian noise \\(v\\) that is modeled after a normal distribution with known variance. that is \\(v \\sim \\mathcal{n}(0, r)\\). this indicates how much we trust the measurements provided by the sensors. this variable is called measurement noise covariance matrix states kalman filters are made up from what it's called states, and we differentiate two different kinds of states: observables (in our case the location) hidden (in our case the velocity, which i can never observe) these two types of states interact with each other in the sense that a sequence of observable variables gives us information about the hidden variables. thus we can estimate what these hidden variables are. applied to our case scenario, multiple observations of where we are, that is, our location, we can estimate how fast we are moving, that is, our velocity. predicting velocity given the following graph: where \\(\\hat{x}\\) represents the velocity and \\(x\\) represents the location. in this first instance, we represent the measurement at with an elongated gaussian because the measurement does not tell us anything about the velocity. however, if we now draw our predicition, given by our motion model which is represented by the red gaussian distribution, we obtain: suppose we take a new measurement (a second observation) represeted by the green normal distribution (remember, it tells us nothing about the velocity), it only gives us information about the location as the first observation did. then: multiply the prior (the red gaussian) and the measurement (the green gaussian) to obtain a really good estimate of an object's velocity and location (black distribution): so we were able to infer the velocity by only observing the location. high dimensional spaces up until now we have generally been operating in a one dimensional space, however if we were to work withing higher dimensional spaces we would need to make use of multivariate gaussians. so a multivariate gaussian in a d-dimensional space is characterized as follows: \\begin{align} \\mu = \\begin{bmatrix} \\mu_0 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\mu_d \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}, \\sigma = \\begin{bmatrix} \\sigma_{11} & \\cdots & \\sigma_{1d}\\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\sigma_{d1} & \\cdots & \\sigma_{dd}\\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\end{align} also de density function is now, for \\(x \\in \\mathbb{r}^d\\): \\begin{align} f(x) = (2\\pi)^{-\\frac{d}{2}}|\\sigma|^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\exp^{-\\frac{1}{2}(x - \\mu)^t\\sigma^{-1}(x-\\mu)} \\end{align} here are some examples of how the kalman filter works for spaces with higher dimension: put everything together motion at a given time \\(k-1\\), we have the following prediction: we use a motion model (in our case a gaussian that represents the movement) to update our prediction as follows: the motion model is described as follows: \\begin{align} x_k = f_{k-1}x_{k-1} + u_{k-1} \\end{align} where: \\(f_{k-1}\\) represents the transition function at time \\(k-1\\) \\(u_{k-1}\\) represents the noise at time \\(k-1\\) measurement then, we use the following observation model: we correct our prediction with this observation model as follows: the measurement model is described as follows: \\begin{align} y_k = h_k x_k + v_k \\end{align} where: \\(h_k\\) is the measurement function at time \\(k\\). this function maps the state into the observable state, that does not have to be the same (refer to states) \\(v_k\\) is the noise at time \\(k\\) iterative process first we make a prediction as to where the robot is at time \\(k\\): \\begin{align} \\check{x}_k = f_{k-1}x_{k-1} \\end{align} \\begin{align} \\check{p}_k = f_{k-1}\\hat{p}_{k-1}f_{k-1}^t + q_{k-1} \\end{align} then we compute the optimal gain \\(k\\) as follows: \\begin{align} k_k = \\check{p}_kh_k^t(h_k\\check{p}_kh^t+r_k)^{-1} \\end{align} this gain basically represents how much we trust our motion estimation versus our measurement estimation. finally we obtain the correction using the measurement model: shift the mean: \\begin{align} \\hat{x}_k = \\check{x}_k + k_k(y_k - h_k\\check{x}_k) \\end{align} where \\(y_k - h_k\\check{x}_k\\) represents the difference between the measurement and the prediction we made. lastly, we update the covariance of our motion model: update the variance: \\begin{align} \\hat{p}_k = (1-k_kh_k)\\check{p}_k \\end{align} algorithm so in the kalman filter cycle what we do is: first we perform the prediction and the correction or measurement update. more concretely: prediction we apply the same formulas we defined in motion model and iterative process to make a prediction: \\begin{align} x = fx + u \\end{align} \\begin{align} p = f \\cdot p \\cdot f^t \\end{align} measurement update now, for the correction: first we compute the intermediate \\(s\\) matrix, which equals the second part of the formula for \\(k\\), \\(h_k\\check{p}_kh^t+r_k\\): \\begin{align} s = h \\cdot p \\cdot h^t + r \\end{align} then we compute the kalman gain (as we defined in iterative process): \\begin{align} k = ph^ts^{-1} \\end{align} obtain difference between measurement (\\(z = y_k\\)) and our prediction \\(h \\cdot x = h_k\\check{x}_k\\) (note where \\(\\check{x}_k\\) comes from, \\(h\\) is usually a matrix that selects a concrete part of the kalman state like the position. see examples): \\begin{align} y = z - h \\cdot x \\end{align} finally obtain the correction: \\begin{align} x' = x + (k \\cdot y) \\end{align} \\begin{align} p' = (i- k\\cdot h) \\cdot p \\end{align} code the filter algorithm follows the same steps laid out in the previous section: def filter(x, p): for n in range(len(measurements)): # prediction x = (f * x) + u p = f * p * f.transpose() # measurement update z = matrix([measurements[n]]) y = z.transpose() - (h * x) s = h * p * h.transpose() + r k = p * h.transpose() * s.inverse() x = x + (k * y) p = (i - (k * h)) * p return x, p $(\"pre\").each(function

x_0)\\), \\((x-2 - x_1)\\), \\((x-3 - x_2)\\) (indicated by the red lines). ideally these are the same as the robot motion (direction vector), however in reality it tends to bend to accommodate the map. relative measurement constraints: these are the segment between each position vector (not necessarily every position vector) and each landmark defined in the map, and are also captured by gaussian distributions. in our case \\(z_0, z_1, z_2, z_3\\), the lines colored in green. after we have collected these constraints, what the algorithm does is it relaxes the position vectors \\(x_i\\) to find the most likely configuration of robot path for the given landmarks (that is measurements of distance to the landmark). constraint matrix to define our constraints, suppose we have 3 position vectors \\(x_0, x_1, x_2\\) and two landmarks \\(l_0, l_1\\), then we define the following matrix: \\begin{align} \\begin{array}{c} \\begin{array} - & x_0 & x_1 & x_2 & l_0 & l_1 \\end{array}\\\\[5pt] \\begin{matrix} x_0 \\\\ x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ l_0 \\\\ l_1 \\end{matrix}\\quad \\begin{bmatrix} 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\\\ 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\\\ 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\\\ 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\\\ 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 0.0 \\\\ 0.0 \\\\ 0.0 \\\\ 0.0 \\\\ 0.0 \\end{bmatrix}\\quad \\end{array} \\end{align} we denote this structure as follows: \\begin{align} \\omega = \\begin{bmatrix} 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\\\ 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\\\ 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\\\ 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\\\ 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\end{bmatrix} \\end{align} and: \\begin{align} \\xi = \\begin{bmatrix} 0.0 \\\\ 0.0 \\\\ 0.0 \\\\ 0.0 \\\\ 0.0 \\end{bmatrix} \\end{align} suppose \\(x_0\\) moves to \\(x_1\\) by moving \\(5\\) units to the right, that is \\(x_1 = x_0 + 5\\), then we define this constrain in the matrix as follows: \\begin{align} \\begin{array}{c} \\begin{array} - & x_0 & x_1 & x_2 & l_0 & l_1 \\end{array}\\\\[5pt] \\begin{matrix} x_0 \\\\ x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ l_0 \\\\ l_1 \\end{matrix}\\quad \\begin{bmatrix} 1.0 & -1.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\\\ -1.0 & 1.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\\\ 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\\\ 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\\\ 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} -5.0 \\\\ 5.0 \\\\ 0.0 \\\\ 0.0 \\\\ 0.0 \\end{bmatrix}\\quad \\end{array} \\end{align} because given the initial constraint \\(x_1 = x_0 + 5\\), if we move around the \\(x_i\\) we get: \\begin{align} x_0 - x_1 = -5 \\end{align} \\begin{align} x_1 - x_0 = 5 \\end{align} now we add another constraint \\(x2 = x_1 - 4\\), therefore: \\begin{align} x_2 - x_1 = -4 \\end{align} \\begin{align} x_1 - x_2 = 4 \\end{align} so the constraint matrix is updated to: \\begin{align} \\begin{array}{c} \\begin{array} - & x_0 & x_1 & x_2 & l_0 & l_1 \\end{array}\\\\[5pt] \\begin{matrix} x_0 \\\\ x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ l_0 \\\\ l_1 \\end{matrix}\\quad \\begin{bmatrix} 1.0 & -1.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\\\ -1.0 & 2.0 & -1.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\\\ 0.0 & -1.0 & 1.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\\\ 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\\\ 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} -5.0 \\\\ 9.0 \\\\ -4.0 \\\\ 0.0 \\\\ 0.0 \\end{bmatrix}\\quad \\end{array} \\end{align} we add a relative measurement constraint like \\(l_0 - x_1 = 9\\), therefore: \\begin{align} l_0 - x_1 = 9 \\end{align} \\begin{align} x_1 - l_0 = -9 \\end{align} so the constraint matrix is updated to: \\begin{align} \\begin{array}{c} \\begin{array} - & x_0 & x_1 & x_2 & l_0 & l_1 \\end{array}\\\\[5pt] \\begin{matrix} x_0 \\\\ x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ l_0 \\\\ l_1 \\end{matrix}\\quad \\begin{bmatrix} 1.0 & -1.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\\\ -1.0 & 3.0 & -1.0 & -1.0 & 0.0 \\\\ 0.0 & -1.0 & 1.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\\\ 0.0 & -1.0 & 0.0 & 1.0 & 0.0 \\\\ 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} -5.0 \\\\ 0.0 \\\\ -4.0 \\\\ 9.0 \\\\ 0.0 \\end{bmatrix}\\quad \\end{array} \\end{align} note that whenever we add a constraint to two parameters, let's say \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\), we sum one to the diagonal element of the matrix corresponding to \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\). noise given the following motion: we know that the localization of our robot is not an exact value, but is is modeled after a gaussian distribution, so \\(x_1 \\sim \\mathcal{n}(\\mu_{x_1}, \\sigma_{x_1})\\) and \\(x_2 \\sim \\mathcal{n}(\\mu_{x_2}, \\sigma_{x_2})\\). suppose \\(\\sigma_{x_1} = \\sigma_{x_2}\\). then we want to maximize the expected value, which is given by the expressions: \\begin{align} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}}\\exp{-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{(x_1-x_0-10)^2}{\\sigma^2}} \\end{align} \\begin{align} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}}\\exp{-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{(x_2 - x_1 -5)^2}{\\sigma^2}} \\end{align} to maximize both expressions means to maximize their product: \\begin{align} \\max_{x_0, x_1, x_2} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}}\\exp{-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{(x_1-x_0-10)^2}{\\sigma^2}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}}\\exp{-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{(x_2 - x_1 -5)^2}{\\sigma^2}} \\end{align} we also know that constants are irrelevant during maximization: \\begin{align} \\max_{x_0, x_1, x_2} \\exp{-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{(x_1-x_0-10)^2}{\\sigma^2}} \\cdot \\exp{-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{(x_2 - x_1 -5)^2}{\\sigma^2}} \\end{align} this maximization is equivalent to the maximization of its logarithm: \\begin{align} \\max_{x_0, x_1, x_2} \\log \\left(\\exp{-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{(x_1-x_0-10)^2}{\\sigma^2}} \\cdot \\exp{-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{(x_2 - x_1 -5)^2}{\\sigma^2}}\\right) \\end{align} because the logarithm of a product equal the sum of logarithms: \\begin{align} \\max_{x_0, x_1, x_2} \\left(\\log \\exp{-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{(x_1-x_0-10)^2}{\\sigma^2}}\\right) + \\left(\\log \\exp{-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{(x_2 - x_1 -5)^2}{\\sigma^2}}\\right) \\end{align} given \\(\\log \\exp (x) = x\\): \\begin{align} \\max_{x_0, x_1, x_2} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{(x_1-x_0-10)^2}{\\sigma^2}\\right) + \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{(x_2 - x_1 -50)^2}{\\sigma^2}\\right) \\end{align} again, constants are irrelevant: \\begin{align} \\max_{x_0, x_1, x_2} \\left(\\frac{(x_1-x_0-10)^2}{\\sigma^2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{(x_2 - x_1 -5)^2}{\\sigma^2}\\right) \\end{align} so, we end up with equations of the form: \\begin{align} \\frac{1}{\\sigma} x_1 - \\frac{1}{\\sigma} x_0 = \\frac{10}{\\sigma} \\end{align} where now \\(\\sigma\\) symbolizes how confident you are in your location/measurement. usually we define a \\(\\sigma\\) for the location and another \\(\\sigma_{measurement}\\) for the measurement (distance to the landmark). $(\"pre\").each(function (index, item) { $(item).html(\"<code>\" + $(item).html() + \"</code>\"); }); hljs.highlightall(); "

parts of the map are occupied and which are free. features vs volumetric maps feature map representations store where on the environment certain points or landmarks lay that the systems uses in order to estimate where it is. volumetric maps are most typically used to store free space. description of the mapping task the goal to obtain a map of a given environment is to compute the most likely map given the sensor data: \\[ m^* = \\arg \\max_m p(m|u_1,z_1, \\cdots, u_t,z_t) \\] however, we will simplify this problem by assuming we already know the poses for certain, thus we swap the control commands \\(u_t\\) for poses \\(x_t\\): \\[ m^* = \\arg \\max_m p(m|x_1,z_1, \\cdots, x_t,z_t) \\] grid maps grid maps discretize the environment by dividing it into a finite number of cells, which encode information about its occupation. that is, a cell is either free or occupied. grids are rigid structures, where cells are distributed uniformly along the grid and represent a definite space. generally we describe cells as pixels. assumptions for each cell, the area corresponding to the cell are completely free or occupied. every cell can be described with a binary random variable that models the occupancy: the world is static. the cells are independent of each other. which means: if i know the occupancy state of a given cell, it does not help me estimate the occupancy state of another. occupancy probability as we have said, each cell is a binary random variable that models the occupancy, that is: if we are certain a cell \\(m_i\\) is occupied: \\(p(m_i) = 1\\) if we are certain a cell \\(m_i\\) is free: \\(p(m_i) = 0\\) if we have no knowledge about the cell \\(m_i\\): \\(p(m_i) = 0.5\\) notation the probability of a cell \\(m_i\\) being occupied is expressed as follows: \\[ p(m_i = occ) = p_{occ}(m_i) = p(m_i) \\] the probability of it being free is given by: \\[ p(m_i = free) = p_{free}(m_i) = 1- p_{occ}(m_i) = p(\\neg m_i) \\] also, the shading in the map tells us how certain we are about \\(p(m_i)\\), that is the more intense the shade the higher the probability. joint distribution the map is described by a probability distribution defined as the joint belief of each cell in the map: \\[ p(m) = p(m_1, m_2, \\cdots, m_n) \\] to simplify this distribution we exploit one of the assumptions made before, that said cells were independent of each other, thus: \\[ p(m) = \\prod_i p(m_i) \\] estimating a map from data our goal is to estimate the map given the sensor data \\(z_{1:t}\\) and the poses \\(x_{1:t}\\), that is: \\[ p(m | z_{1:t}, x_{1:t}) = \\prod_i p(m_i|z_{1:t}, x_{1:t}) \\] in order to do this we use a variant of the bayes filter called binary bayes filter that is optimized for binary random variables (\\(m_i\\)). static state binary bayes filter so, for each cell in the environment \\(m_i\\) we compute: \\[ p(m_i|z_{1:t}, x_{1:t}) \\] we apply the bayes rule to swap \\(m_i\\) for \\(z_t\\), therefore: \\[

the previous observations \\(z_{1:t-1}\\) and poses \\(x_{1:t-1}\\), therefore: \\[ p(m_i|z_{1:t}, x_{1:t}) = \\frac{p(z_t|m_i, x_t)p(m_i, z_{1:t-1}, x_{1:t})}{p(z_t | z_{1:t-1}, x_{1:t})} \\] we also make use of the markov's assumption to discard future poses when we the most up to date observation is of \\(t-1\\): \\[ p(m_i|z_{1:t}, x_{1:t}) = \\frac{p(z_t|m_i, x_t)p(m_i, z_{1:t-1}, x_{1:t-1})}{p(z_t | z_{1:t-1}, x_{1:t})} \\] we apply bayes rule again over \\(p(z_t|m_i, x_t)\\) to swap \\(z_t\\) and \\(m_i\\) again: \\[ p(z_t|m_i, x_t) = \\frac{p(m_i|z_t, x_t) p(z_t|x_t)}{p(m_i|x_t)} \\] we plug this into the previous expression: \\[ p(m_i|z_{1:t}, x_{1:t}) = \\frac{p(m_i|z_t, x_t) p(z_t|x_t) p(m_i, z_{1:t-1}, x_{1:t-1})}{p(m_i|x_t) p(z_t | z_{1:t-1},

\\[ \\frac{p(m_i|z_{1:t}, x_{1:t})}{p(\\neg m_i|z_{1:t}, x_{1:t})} = \\frac{\\frac{p(m_i|z_t, x_t) p(z_t|x_t) p(m_i, z_{1:t-1}, x_{1:t-1})}{p(m_i) p(z_t | z_{1:t-1}, x_{1:t})}}{\\frac{p(\\neg m_i|z_t,

| z_{1:t-1}, x_{1:t})\\), then \\[ \\frac{p(m_i|z_{1:t}, x_{1:t})}{p(\\neg m_i|z_{1:t}, x_{1:t})} = \\frac{\\frac{p(m_i|z_t, x_t)p(m_i, z_{1:t-1}, x_{1:t-1})}{p(m_i)}}{\\frac{p(\\neg m_i|z_t, x_t) p(\\neg m_i, z_{1:t-1}, x_{1:t-1})}{p(\\neg m_i)}} \\] we reorganize the expression: \\[ \\frac{p(m_i|z_{1:t}, x_{1:t})}{p(\\neg m_i|z_{1:t}, x_{1:t})} = \\frac{p(m_i|z_t, x_t)p(m_i, z_{1:t-1},

have three expressions: the first one uses the observation \\(z_t\\) the second one is a recursive term the third one describes our prior knowledge about the state of the cell without any other information about the environment. odds ratio what we do now is turn this ratio called odds ratio into the probability as follows: \\[ odds(x) = \\frac{p(x)}{1-p(x)} \\] we multiply by \\(1-p(x)\\) in both sides. \\[ odds(x)(1-p(x)) = p(x) \\] we expand the left hand side expression: \\[ odds(x)-odds(x)p(x) = p(x) \\] we add \\(odds(x)p(x)\\) to both sides: \\[ odds(x) = p(x) + odds(x)p(x) \\] we extract \\(p(x)\\) as a common factor on the right hand side: \\[ odds(x) = p(x) (1 + odds(x)) \\] we divide by \\((1 + odds(x))\\) on both sides: \\[ \\frac{odds(x)}{(1 + odds(x))} = p(x) \\] and finally: \\[ p(x) = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{odds(x)} \\right)} \\] so by using: \\[ p(x) = [1 + odds(x)^{-1}]^{-1} \\] in our update rule: \\[ p(m_i | z_{1:t}, x_{1:t}) = \\left[1 + (\\frac{p(m_i|z_{1:t}, x_{1:t})}{1-p(m_i|z_{1:t}, x_{1:t})})^{-1}\\right]^{-1} \\] \\[ p(m_i | z_{1:t}, x_{1:t}) = \\left[1 + \\frac{1-p(m_i|z_{1:t}, x_{1:t})}{p(m_i|z_{1:t}, x_{1:t})}\\right]^{-1} \\] because: \\[ \\frac{p(m_i|z_{1:t}, x_{1:t})}{1-p(m_i|z_{1:t}, x_{1:t})} = \\frac{p(m_i|z_t, x_t)}{ 1- p(m_i|z_t, x_t)} \\frac{p(m_i, z_{1:t-1}, x_{1:t-1})}{1-p(m_i, z_{1:t-1}, x_{1:t-1})} \\frac{1-p(m_i)}{ p(m_i)} \\] the inverse equals: \\[ \\frac{1-p(m_i|z_{1:t}, x_{1:t})}{p(m_i|z_{1:t}, x_{1:t})} = \\frac{ 1- p(m_i|z_t, x_t)}{p(m_i|z_t, x_t)} \\frac{1-p(m_i, z_{1:t-1}, x_{1:t-1})}{p(m_i, z_{1:t-1}, x_{1:t-1})} \\frac{ p(m_i)}{1-p(m_i)} \\] therefore: \\[ p(m_i | z_{1:t}, x_{1:t}) = \\left[1 + \\frac{ 1- p(m_i|z_t, x_t)}{p(m_i|z_t, x_t)} \\frac{1-p(m_i, z_{1:t-1}, x_{1:t-1})}{p(m_i, z_{1:t-1}, x_{1:t-1})} \\frac{ p(m_i)}{1-p(m_i)}\\right]^{-1} \\] which means, we can obtain information about the state of the \\(m_i\\) grid cell given the observation and the positions. log odds notation to make the computation more efficient we are going to take the log of this expression. the notation will be the following: \\[ l(m_i | z_{1:t}, x_{1:t}) = \\log \\left(\\frac{1-p(m_i|z_{1:t}, x_{1:t})}{p(m_i|z_{1:t}, x_{1:t})}\\right) \\] note that we can map from the log space to the probability space and vice versa as follows: \\[ l(x) = \\log

the log of each term. \\[ l(m_i|z_{1:t}, x_{1:t}) = l(m_i|z_t,x_t) + l(m_i|z_{1:t-1}, x_{1:t-1}) - l(m_i) \\] where: \\(l(m_i|z_t,x_t)\\) is the inverse sensor model, which contains information about what we sensed. \\(l(m_i|z_{1:t-1}, x_{1:t-1})\\) is the recursive term, that is the state of cell on the previous iteration. \\(l(m_i)\\) is the prior. in short: \\[ l_{t,i} = inv\\_sensor\\_model(m_i, x_t, z_t) + l_{t-1, i} - l_0 \\] algorithm as we can see in the algorithm what we do is, given an observation \\(z_t\\) we go through each cell, and if the cell is close to the area where the observation took place then we update the state of the cell taking into account the sensor information. else we just propagate the previous state into the current state: inverse sensor model for laser range finders on the following graph we show the way we update the occupancy probability of the cells. here, the x axis represent several cells and the y axis represents the occupancy probability. at cell \\(n\\) our scanner detects an obstacle at time \\(t\\), this corresponds to the observation \\(z_{t,n}\\). therefore: the probability of cells prior to cell \\(n\\) of being occupied is low, because we were able to shot a laser through them without encountering no obstacle the probability of the n-th cell of being occupied is high, because it is the place where we found the obstacle. the probability of cells after \\(n\\) of bain occupied is unknown because we cannot see after the laser. a similar idea could be applied to sonar range sensor, which measure an area instead of a line: however the graph is a bit different, we now take into account that the sensor might not be completely reliable, therefore when the sonar detects an obstacle at a given distance we spread the probability of being occupied over adjacent cells/distances. example the idea is to add sensor information to a current \"map\" to increase the certainty of the state of each

\\mu_{t-1})\\) tells us how far we are away from the linearization point \\(\\mu_{t-1}\\). for the correction step we linearize around our predicted state \\(\\overline{x}_t = (\\overline{\\mu}_t, \\overline{\\sigma}_t)\\): \\[ h(x_t) \\approx h(\\overline{\\mu}_t) + \\frac{\\delta h(\\overline{\\mu}_t)}{\\delta x_t} (x_t -

a_tx_{t-1} - b_tu_t)^tr^{-1}_t(x_t - a_tx_{t-1} - b_tu_t)) \\] if our world is non-linear we substitute \\[ x_t = a_tx_{t-1} + b_tu_t + \\epsilon_t \\] for \\[ x_t = g(u_t, x_{t-1}) + \\epsilon_t \\] therefore the motion model is expressed as follows: \\[ p(x_t|x_{t-1}, u_t) = \\det(2\\pi r_t)^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\exp(-\\frac{1}{2}(x_t -

h(\\overline{\\mu}_{t}))^tq^{-1}_t(z_t - h(\\overline{\\mu}_{t}))) \\] finally we find a linear approximation, such that: \\[ h(x_t) \\approx h(\\overline{\\mu}_t) + \\frac{\\delta h(\\overline{\\mu}_t)}{\\delta x_t} (x_t - \\overline{\\mu}_t) = h(\\overline{\\mu}_t) + h_t (x_t - \\overline{\\mu}_t) \\] and the linearized observation model becomes: \\[ p(z_t|x_t) = \\det(2\\pi q_t)^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\cdot \\] \\[ \\cdot \\exp(-\\frac{1}{2}(z_t -

h(\\overline{\\mu}_t)) \\] \\[ \\mu_t = \\overline{\\mu}_t + h_t^{-1} (z_t - h(\\overline{\\mu}_t)) \\] \\[ \\mu_t = \\overline{\\mu}_t + h_t^{-1} z_t - h_t^{-1}h(\\overline{\\mu}_t) \\] with \\(h_t^{-1}h(\\overline{\\mu}_t)\\) what we are doing is, first computing \\(h(\\overline{\\mu}_t)\\) to map \\(\\overline{\\mu}_t\\) to the observation space, and the undoing this mapping with \\(h_t^{-1}\\), which means: \\[ \\mu_t = \\overline{\\mu}_t + h_t^{-1} z_t - \\overline{\\mu}_t \\] \\[ \\mu_t = \\overline{\\mu}_t - \\overline{\\mu}_t + h_t^{-1} z_t \\] \\[ \\mu_t = h_t^{-1} z_t \\] where \\(h_t^{-1}\\) maps \\(z_t\\) from the observation space to the state space, and this means in this update we trust our observation completely, and therefore our estate equals the observation. on the contrary, suppose the sensor is very unreliable, and so the noise is set to be infinity. then the correction step is executed as follows: \\[ k_t = \\overline{\\sigma}_t h_t^t \\cdot (h_t \\overline{\\sigma}_t h_t^t + q_t)^{-1} \\] \\[ k_t = \\overline{\\sigma}_t h_t^t \\cdot (h_t \\overline{\\sigma}_t h_t^t + \\infty)^{-1} \\] because we are dividing by infinity, \\(k_t = 0\\). so the mean of our belief is computed as follows: \\[ \\mu_t = \\overline{\\mu}_t + k_t (z_t - h(\\overline{\\mu}_t)) \\] \\[ \\mu_t = \\overline{\\mu}_t + 0 (z_t - h(\\overline{\\mu}_t)) \\] \\[ \\mu_t = \\overline{\\mu}_t \\] hence, if the measurement is too noisy, we only take into account our predicted state. localization example localization example using extended kalman filter (from 11') $(\"pre\").each(function (index, item) { $(item).html(\"<code>\" + $(item).html() + \"</code>\"); }); hljs.highlightall(); "

c_t \\overline{\\mu}_t\\) (again \\(c\\) to map to the observation space). then we change the estimated state by this error pondered by \\(k\\). we also update our uncertainty assumptions we can apply the kalman filter as long as the two following assumptions hold: everything is gaussian the motion and observation model are linear however, what if this is not the case? extended kalman filter $(\"pre\").each(function (index, item) { $(item).html(\"<code>\" + $(item).html() + \"</code>\"); }); hljs.highlightall(); "

x_t, z_{1:t-1}, u_{1:t}) \\cdot p(x_t|z_{1:t-1}, u_{1:t}) \\] where \\(\\eta\\) is a normalization constant. now, let's pay attention to \\(p(z_t | x_t, z_{1:t-1}, u_{1:t})\\). by the markov assumption we are going to assume that the current state \\(x_t\\) and the previous observations and control commands are conditionally independent. that is, they do not give any information about the likelihood of the observation \\(z_t\\). thus, we drop them from the equation: \\[ = \\eta \\cdot p(z_t | x_t) \\cdot p(x_t|z_{1:t-1}, u_{1:t}) \\] for \\(p(x_t|z_{1:t-1}, u_{1:t})\\) we are going to use the law of total probability to add a new variable, so we integrate over this new variable. more concretely to add \\(x_{t-1}\\), which will allow us to introduce recursion to our expression: \\[ = \\eta \\cdot p(z_t | x_t) \\cdot \\int p(x_t | x_{t-1}, z_{1:t-1}, u_{1:t}) \\cdot p(x_{t-1}|z_{1:t-1},u_{1:t}) dx_{t-1} \\] we could interpret this rewritten expression as: for each previous state \\(x_{t-1}\\) we multiply \\(p(x_t | x_{t-1}, z_{1:t-1}, u_{1:t})\\), the probability of being in the new state \\(x_t\\) given the previous state \\(x_{t-1}\\), observations \\(z_{1:t-1}\\) and control commands \\(u_{1:t}\\) by \\(p(x_{t-1}|z_{1:t-1},u_{1:t})\\), the probability of being in the state \\(x_{t-1}\\) given the previous observations \\(z_{1:t-1}\\) and control commands \\(u_{1:t}\\) once again we apply the markov assumption over \\(p(x_t | x_{t-1}, z_{1:t-1}, u_{1:t})\\), because knowing where i am at moment \\(t-1\\), we assume the observations \\(z_{1:t-1}\\) do not add any information. however note the control command does indeed hold valuable information, as it tells us action last executed that moved us from \\(x_{t-1}\\) to \\(x_t\\). so we simplify the expression as follows: \\[ = \\eta \\cdot p(z_t | x_t) \\cdot \\int p(x_t | x_{t-1}, u_{1:t}) \\cdot p(x_{t-1}|z_{1:t-1},u_{1:t}) dx_{t-1} \\] we now suppose that knowing what action or command is executed in the future does not tell us anything about the present. hence we ignore the latest control command \\(u_t\\), so the expression becomes: \\[ = \\eta \\cdot p(z_t | x_t) \\cdot \\int p(x_t | x_{t-1}, u_{1:t}) \\cdot p(x_{t-1}|z_{1:t-1},u_{1:t-1}) dx_{t-1} \\] note that we have finally derived a recursive expression for our belief, given: \\[ bel(x_{t-1}) = p(x_{t-1}|z_{1:t-1}, u_{1:t-1}) \\] we substitute this expression in the belief at time \\(t\\): \\[ = \\eta \\cdot p(z_t | x_t) \\cdot \\int p(x_t | x_{t-1}, u_{1:t}) \\cdot bel(x_{t-1}) dx_{t-1} \\] prediction and correction step usually the bayes filter is broken up into: prediction step: estimates where the future state is based on the control command at time \\(t\\) and makes use of the motion model. motion model: \\(p(x_t | x_{t-1}, u_{1:t})\\) \\[ \\hat{bel}(x_t) = \\int p(x_t | x_{t-1}, u_{1:t}) \\cdot bel(x_{t-1}) dx_{t-1} \\] correction step: we get an observation that we use to correct potential mistakes we make in the prediction step. this correction is made using the observation or measurement model. observation model: \\(p(z_t | x_t)\\) \\[ bel(x_t) = \\eta \\cdot p(z_t | x_t) \\cdot \\hat{bel}(x_t) \\] implementation in order to implement a bayes filter we need to define certain things: specify the motion model specify the observation model specify the belief how do we move from one state to the next (i.e. linear model, non-linear model) popular filters kalman filters and efk use gaussians to represent the belief, motion model and observation model they use linear or linearized models particle filter the can use arbitrary models to represent state, motion model and observation model model examples motion model given a current state \\(x_t\\), the motion model could look like: in the first case, let's suppose a point represents the next state \\(x_{t+1}\\) after the control command is applied. if we execute our system \\(n\\) times, we get \\(n\\) estimations that are illustrated by the \\(n\\) points in the graph. they represent an approximation of the distribution that describes our predicted state (illustrated by the graph in the upper left corner). this distribution is our motion model at time \\(t+1\\). for the two middle graphs, we can deduce that our system is certain about the angle of motion, however it shows more uncertainty about the distance. finally in the last two graphs we see the opposite. the system knows how much we moved, that is the distance, but is uncertain about the angle of movement. measurement model suppose we have a sensor that tell us the distance between us and the closest obstacle in front of us. we know that this sensor is noisy, so to mimic that noise we can describe the measurement model as a normal distribution. in the previous image, the star represents the closest obstacle, and we use the gaussian distribution to describe how likely it is of obtaining a given measurement. observe that the further we move away from the actual obstacle the lower is the probability of that measurement taking place. $(\"pre\").each(function (index, item) { $(item).html(\"<code>\" + $(item).html() +

it turns out we can do this by sampling from a different probability function that the actual probability function and then compensating for the mistakes that we have done by drawing from this \"mistaken\" probability function. to do this we apply the importance sampling principle which tells us: we can use a different distribution (proposal distribution) \\(\\pi\\) to generate samples from the target (real) distribution \\(f\\). we need to account for the differences between \\(\\pi\\) and \\(f\\) using a weight, given by \\(\\omega = \\frac{f(x)}{\\pi{x}}\\) we need to assert the following pre-condition: \\(f(x) > 0 \\rightarrow \\pi(x) > 0\\) you can see that the weights are larger where the difference between the proposal and the target function is bigger. observe on the right side of the graph that we have drawn a low number of samples because our proposal probability function tells us the us the density on that region is low. however the target function shows a high probability in that same region, so by computing the difference between the proposal and the target function we assign bigger weights to those few particles. characteristics it is a recursive bayes filter uses a non-parametric approach models the distribution using samples and so the model need not be linear. the prediction step consists of drawing samples from the proposal function (takes the motion into account) the correction step consists of weighting the samples by the ration between the target function and the proposal function (takes the observation into account) the more particles we use to approximate the probability function the better the estimate is. algorithm the algorithm is composed of the following three steps: (prediction step) sample the particles using the proposal distribution (this signifies: where could my system be?). because we can choose the proposal function, what we do in this step is sampling from the motion model: \\[ x_t^{[j]} \\sim proposal(x_t|\\cdots) \\] (correction step) compute the importance weights to compensate from the mistakes made by sampling from the proposal distribution. if we derive the following expression, we obtain that the weights are given by the observation model: \\[ w_t^{[j]} = \\frac{target(x_t^{j})}{proposal(x_t^{j})} \\] resampling: draw with replacement \\(j\\) samples \\(i\\) with probability \\(w_t^{[i]}\\). so now we have a resampled set of samples where we update the weights by dividing the by \\(1/j\\) so they are normalized. what we do is generate a new set of samples where we replace the weight by the frequency. we do this because we work with a finite number of samples, so it could be the case that some particles have a very low probability and thus contribute very little to approximating the probability function. so it is better to eliminate those samples and replace them with a sample that is located in an area with high probability. we start with a empty sample set for the prediction step \\(\\hat{\\mathcal{x}}_t\\) and for the correction step \\(\\mathcal{x}_t\\). (prediction step) for \\(j=1\\cdots j\\): sample particle \\(x^{[j]}_t\\) from the proposal distribution \\(\\pi(x_t)\\), this distribution can be defined by the user, and corresponds to the belief at time \\(t-1\\) and constrained to the control command at time \\(t\\), \\(u_t\\). compute the weight by obtaining the difference between the proposal distribution and the target distribution. this results in using the observation model save the pair \\(x_t^{[j]}\\), \\(w_t^{[j]}\\) to the prediction sample set \\(\\hat{\\mathcal{x}}_t\\). (correction step) for \\(j=1\\cdots j\\): draw a particle \\(x_t^{[j]}\\) with replacement from the prediction sample set with probability proportional to the weight of the sample \\(w_t^{[j]}\\). add the particle to the correction sample set \\(\\mathcal{x}_t\\) return the resampled sample set \\(\\mathcal{x}_t\\) summary what the particle filter does is: it takes each particle as a pose hypothesis that says \"this is where the system is at time \\(t\\)\". then it adds weight to each particle signifying how much that pose hypothesis conforms to the given observation, and tells us how likely the hypothesis is. if we do this with \\(n\\) particles what we obtain is a belief, that is, a set of possibilities of where we are which describe my probability distribution. monte carlo localization monte carlo localization refers to the estimation the location and orientation of the system using a particle filter. for example: with a particle filter, our belief shows where the robot is located by having a bigger density of particles right under where the robot is. another example is the following, where we start with all the particles scattered over the map that means the particles are sampled from a uniform distribution so every point in space is equally likely to be the location of the robot. once the robot drives around and obtains new measurements the probability mass concentrates on places where the robot is more likely to be in given the motion commands and the observations. eventually the system converges and you end up with a unimodal distribution that is similar to a gaussian distribution. structure each particle represents a pose hypothesis we represent the proposal probability function by drawing from the motion model. because we are sampling from the motion distribution what we do is increasing the uncertainty about the motion at time \\(t\\) and thus account for the noise present in each motion. \\[ x_t^{[j]} \\sim p(x_t|x_{t-1}, u_t) \\] we apply the correction via the observation model. so the weight of each particle is proportional to the likelihood of an observation \\(z_t\\) given i know where i am \\(x_t\\) and the map of the environment \\(m\\). this result is dependent of the choice made previously of sampling from the motion model. \\[ w_t^{[j]} = \\frac{target}{proposal} \\propto p(z_t|x_t,m) \\] particle filter algorithm for localization we modify slightly our particle filter algorithm to use it for localization: we sample from the motion model \\(p(x_t|u_t, x^{[j]}_{t-1})\\) instead from the generic proposal function \\(\\pi(x_t)\\) we compute the weights with \\(w_t^{[j]} = \\frac{target}{proposal} \\propto p(z_t|x_t,m)\\). example first we start with a uniform distribution, and we sample from that distribution, obtaining \\(j\\) particles distributed over the space with the same probability. then we obtain an observation, and in the weighting step we increase the weight of the samples with are more likely given the observation. in this case the samples in front of doors, while the rest of the particles get a lower weight. then we apply resampling to replace weight by frequencies (the probability mass of a particle is bigger if this particle has been resampled several times, which means it weight was bigger than the rest of the samples). in the following picture the resampling step is executed along with the motion step (so the probability function is offsetted): because the prediction/motion was already performed before, now we obtain another observation: when we obtain the weights, two things happen. first, and as before, the particles (pose hypothesis) more likely to be correct given the observation obtain a larger weight. second, because the is a bigger number of particles in front of the second door the density in this area is bigger than in the areas in front of the other doors. another resampling and prediction step: resampling techniques roulette wheel first we create a roulette wheel where each field represents a particle, and the bigger the weight associated with that particle the bigger the field is: the idea is that, we normalize the weights, and each time we draw a number between zero and one, which will \"point\" to a weight. however this method can lead to suboptimal solutions. suppose that for some reason each time we end up with uniform weight, so that no particle is more likely than any other. then, with the wheel roulette we will duplicate some particles and remove some others. however this does not make sense, because every particle had the same weight. thus we introduce the lower variance resampling. low variance resampling here, the idea is using \\(j\\) arrows instead of only one, where the arrows are at the same angular distance from each other. so in order to sample what we do is, we simply turn the arrows, and where all the arrows end up, that is the samples we choose. this solution is faster, with time complexity equal to \\(o(j)\\) compared to the wheel roulette's \\(o(j \\log j)\\), and resolves the suboptimal solution problem presented earlier. algorithm first we draw a random number between \\(0\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{j}\\) then we pick \\(j-1\\) particles by advancing in the array in steps of \\(\\frac{1}{j}\\) to efficiently implement this what we do is, in each element of the array we store the cummulative weight up until that point: so, we draw a random number between \\(0\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{j}\\), if that number is bigger than the weight accumulated up until weight \\(i\\), then we move to the next one, else if it is less we sample the particle \\(i\\). and then we advance \\(\\frac{1}{j}\\). $(\"pre\").each(function (index, item) { $(item).html(\"<code>\" + $(item).html() +

\\alpha (h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})x^{(i)} \\end{align} which means that in every interation we are updating \\(\\theta\\) by adding or substracting a factor \\(\\alpha_i\\) multiplied by \\(x^{(i)}\\). therefore we can show by mathematical induction that if we start with \\(\\theta_0 = c\\), where \\(c\\) is a constant and go on adding and substracting \\(ax^{(i)}\\), where \\(a= \\alpha (h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) -

    "body": " index search search back functional margin intuition the functional margin describes how accurately do we classify an example. for example, for binary classification, given an example x: \\begin{align} h_\\theta(x) = g(\\theta x) = \\begin{cases} \\text{ predict } 1 & \\text{ if } \\theta^t x \\geq 0, \\text{ that is } h_\\theta(x)=g(\\theta x) \\geq 0.5\\\\ \\text{ predict } 0 & \\text{ otherwise } \\\\ \\end{cases} \\end{align} let's distinguish between the two cases when classifying an example \\(x^{(i)}\\): (1) if \\(y^{(i)} = 1\\), then we want \\(h_\\theta(x) = g(\\theta x) \\approx 1\\), which means we want \\(\\theta \\cdot x >> 0\\). (2) if \\(y^{(i)} = 0\\), then we want \\(h_\\theta(x) = g(\\theta x) \\approx 0\\), which means we want \\(\\theta \\cdot x << 0\\). as we can see in the following graph, the bigger \\(z = \\theta x\\) the closer \\(g(z)\\) is to one and vice versa. formal definition the functional margin of the hyperplane defined by \\((w, b)\\) with respect to the example \\((x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})\\) is defined as: \\begin{align} \\hat{\\gamma}^{(i)} = y^{(i)}(w^tx^{(i)}+b) \\end{align} so, if we modify slightly the two statements above and use the new notation for svms: if \\(y^{(i)} = 1\\), then we want \\(w^t \\cdot x + b >> 0\\). if \\(y^{(i)} = 0\\), then we want \\(w^t \\cdot x + b << 0\\). the combination of these two declarations yields the definition of the functional margin. why?, well: when \\(y^{(i)}\\) is positive, we want to have \\(w^tx^{(i)} + b >> 0\\) by (1), so \\(\\hat{\\gamma}^{(i)}\\) will be large, because both values are positive when \\(y^{(i)}\\) is negative, we want to have \\(w^tx^{(i)} + b << 0\\) by (2), so \\(\\hat{\\gamma}^{(i)}\\) will be large, because both values are negative so, given an example \\(x^{(i)}\\), if \\(\\hat{\\gamma}^{(i)} > 0\\) that means either \\(y^{(i)} = 1\\) and \\(w^tx + b > 0\\) or \\(y^{(i)} = -1\\) and \\(w^tx + b < 0\\) which shows that the classification is correct. evaluation to evaluate the functional margin with respect to the training set we make use of the worst case notion: \\begin{align} \\hat{\\gamma} = \\underset{i}{\\min} \\hat{\\gamma}^{(i)} \\end{align} that is, we evaluate how well we are doing in the worst example. normalizing the functional margin note that the functional margin is very easy to cheat (to increase its value with any meaningful change to the decision boundary). given our definition for \\(g\\): \\begin{align} g = \\begin{cases} 1, & \\text{ if } z \\geq 0 \\\\ -1, & \\text{ otherwise } \\end{cases} \\end{align} it follows that \\(h_{w,b}(x^{(i)}) = g(2w^tx^{(i)} + 2b) = g(w^tx^{(i)} + b)\\), because what matters is the sign, not the magnitude. however, if you scale \\(w\\) and \\(b\\) by a factor of \\(n\\) where \\(n\\) is a positive number then \\(\\gamma \\) increases because: \\begin{align} \\hat{\\gamma}^{(i)} = (w^tx + b) \\end{align} so, \\begin{align} n \\cdot \\hat{\\gamma}^{(i)} = n \\cdot (w^tx + b) \\end{align} where, \\begin{align} \\hat{\\gamma}^{(i)} < n \\cdot \\hat{\\gamma}^{(i)} \\end{align} one way to avoid this is to normalize the length of the parameters, that is either: add a constraint where \\(||w|| = 1\\) or set \\((w, b)\\) to be \\((\\frac{w}{||w||}, \\frac{b}{||b||})\\) in both cases we are re-scaling the parameters. $(\"pre\").each(function (index, item) { $(item).html(\"<code>\" + $(item).html() + \"</code>\"); }); hljs.highlightall(); "

    "body": " index search search back geometric margin intuition first of all, let's assume we have a dataset that is linearly separable like: here we have two examples of two decision boundaries that do classify correctly all of the samples. however the red one looks worse than the green one. that is because for the red one there are some examples that are very close to the boundary compared to the rest. whereas for the green one there is a bigger separation. so, first we define a line by the equation \\(w^tx + b = 0\\), therefore: every example \\(x\\) that lies to the left of the line satisfies \\(w^tx + b < 0\\) and every example \\(x\\) that lies to the right of the line satisfies \\(w^tx + b > 0\\) furthermore the geometric margin with respect to a single example \\((x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})\\) is the euclidean distance between the point \\((x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})\\) and the line we have defined as \\(w^tx + b = 0\\). euclidean distance to the decision boundary the decision boundary corresponding to (w, b) is shown, along with the vector w. note that w is orthogonal (at 90Âº) to the separating hyperplane. consider the point at \\(a\\), which represents the example \\(x^{(i)}\\) with \\(y^{(i)} = 1\\). its distance to the decision boundary, denoted by \\(\\gamma^{(i)}\\), is given by the line segment \\(ab\\). how do we find \\(\\gamma^{(i)}\\): we know \\(\\frac{w}{||w||}\\) is a unit length vector pointing to the same direction as \\(w\\). also \\(a = x^{(i)}\\) we also know that the vector between points \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is defined like \\(a - b\\), in this scenario, \\(a - b = \\gamma^{(i)}\\frac{w}{||w||}\\), where \\(\\gamma^{(i)}\\) is the length of the vector and \\(\\frac{w}{||w||}\\) is the direction of the vector. thus if we solve for \\(b\\), \\(b = x^{(i)} - \\gamma^{(i)}\\frac{w}{||w||}\\) furthermore, \\(b\\) lies on the decision boundary, therefore: \\begin{align} w^t(b) + b = 0 \\rightarrow w^t\\left(x^{(i)} - \\gamma^{(i)}\\frac{w}{||w||}\\right) + b = 0 \\end{align} solving for \\(y^{(i)}\\) yields: \\begin{align} \\gamma^{(i)} = \\frac{w^tx^{(i)} + b}{||w||} = \\left(\\frac{w}{||w||}\\right)^tx(i) + \\frac{b}{||w||} \\end{align} formal definition the geometric margin of the hyperplane \\((w, b)\\) with respect to \\((x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})\\) is defined as: \\begin{align} \\gamma^{(i)} = \\frac{w^t x^{(i)} + b}{||w||} \\end{align} this is the definition for a positive example (\\(y^{(i)} = 1\\)), and measures the euclidean distance from the decision boundary to the example \\((x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})\\). if we generalize, as to compute the geometric margin for both positive and negative examples: \\begin{align} \\gamma^{(i)} = \\frac{y^{(i)} (w^t x^{(i)} + b)}{||w||} \\end{align} evaluation to evaluate the geometric margin with respect to the training set we make use of the worst case notion: \\begin{align} \\gamma = \\underset{i}{\\min} \\gamma^{(i)} \\end{align} that is, we evaluate how well we are doing in the worst example. $(\"pre\").each(function (index, item) { $(item).html(\"<code>\" + $(item).html() + \"</code>\"); }); hljs.highlightall(); "

(note: a monomial of degree 3 could be \\(x_1x_2x_3\\) or \\(x_1x_2^2\\), etc) validity of kernels to test is a kernel is valid we use mercer's theorem that says: k is a valid kernel function (i.e. \\(\\exists \\phi\\) such that \\(k(x, z) = \\phi(x)^t\\phi(z)\\)) if and only if for any \\(d\\) points \\(\\{x^{(1)}, \\cdots , x^{(d)}\\}\\) the corresponding kernel matrix \\(k\\) is positive semi-definite, that is \\(k \\geq 0\\) we are going to prove the first part of this theorem: given examples \\(\\{x^{(1)}, \\cdots , x^{(d)}\\}\\), let \\(k \\in \\mathbb{r}^{d\\times d}\\), be the kernel matrix, such that \\begin{align} k_{ij} = k(x^{(i)}, x^{(j)}) \\end{align} then, if \\(k\\) is a valid kernel: \\begin{align} z^tkz = \\sum_{i=1}^d \\sum_{j=1}^d z_i^t k_{ij} z_j = \\sum_{i=1}^d \\sum_{j=1}^d z_i^t \\phi(x^{(i)})^t \\phi(x^{(j)}) z_j = \\end{align} we expand \\(\\phi(x^{(i)})^t \\phi(x^{(j)})\\) as follows: \\begin{align} = \\sum_{i=1}^d \\sum_{j=1}^d z_i^t \\left[\\sum_{k=1}^d (\\phi(x^{(i)}))_k (\\phi(x^{(j)}))_k\\right] z_j = \\end{align} now, if we rearrange the sums: \\begin{align} = \\sum_{k=1}^d \\left[\\sum_{i=1}^d z_i (\\phi(x^{(i)}))_k\\right]^2 \\end{align} so, because the power of two of any real number is a positive number, and the sum of positive numbers is positive we derive: \\begin{align} \\sum_{k=1}^d \\left[\\sum_{i=1}^d z_i (\\phi(x^{(i)}))_k\\right]^2 \\geq 0 \\end{align} which means that \\(k \\geq 0\\), hence \\(k\\) is a positive, semi-definite matrix generality of the kernel trick the kernel trick can be applied to more algorithms, not only in svm. because, if you have any algorithm written in terms of \\(\\langle x^{(i)}, x^{(j)} \\rangle\\), you can apply the kernel trick to it. some of the algorithms that can be re-written like this are: lineal regression logistic regression gdm pca etc. l1-norm soft margin svm it may be the case where you map your data to a very high dimensional space, but it is still not linearly separable, or the decision boundary becomes too complex: in order to avoid this we will use a modification of the basic algorithm called l1-norm soft margin svm. with this new algorithm the optimization problem becomes \\begin{align} \\underset{w,b,\\xi_i}{min} \\frac{1}{2}||w||^2 + c \\sum_{i=1}^m \\xi_i \\end{align} subject to \\begin{align} y^{(i)}(w^tx^{(i)} + b) \\geq 1 - \\xi_i \\end{align} \\begin{align} \\xi_i \\geq 0, i = 1, \\cdots, m \\end{align} note that if \\(x^{(i)}\\) is classified correctly then \\(y^{(i)}(w^tx^{(i)} + b) \\geq 0\\) and therefore satisfies \\(y^{(i)}(w^tx^{(i)} + b) \\geq 1 - \\xi_i\\), because \\(\\xi_i \\geq 0\\) before the modification, the restriction forced the functional margin to be at least 1, however after the modification, because \\(\\xi_i\\) is positive we relax the restriction. also, we do not want \\(\\xi_i\\) to be too big, that is why it is added to the optimization objective as a cost. graphical representation with the addition of \\(\\xi_i\\) we are allowing some examples to have a functional margin less than 1, by setting \\(\\xi_i \\geq 0\\). for example look at the example \\(x^{(i)}\\) which has \\(\\xi_i = 0.5\\) outliers this relaxation on the restriction upong the geometric margin also avoids the following problem. if you have a lot of data that is linearly separable, but you have one outlier the optimal margin classifier allows for the decision boundary to be drastically changed because its optimization is based on the word performing example (which would be the outlier in this case). thus: however, the l1-norm soft margin svm allows for this example to be classified incorrectly of be close to the decision boundary without changing the boundary which makes it more robuts to outliers. optimization picking up the optimal margin classifier optimization problem, after applying the insight derived from the representer theorem, we have that the only addition needed to implement this algorithm is: \\begin{align} \\underset{\\alpha}{max} \\sum_{i=1}^m \\alpha_i - \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^m\\sum_{j=1}^m y^{(i)}y^{(j)}\\alpha_i\\alpha_j\\langle x^{(i)}, x^{(j)}\\rangle \\end{align} subject to \\begin{align} \\sum_{i=1} y^{(i)}\\alpha_i = 0 \\end{align} \\begin{align} 0 \\leq \\alpha_i \\leq c, i = 1, \\cdots , m \\end{align} the parameter \\(c\\) is a parameter your choose and it determines the level of strictness you want your model to have about some examples being misclassified. kernel examples the gaussian kernel: \\(k(x, z) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{||x-z||^2}{2\\sigma}\\right)\\) linear kernel: \\(k(x, z) = \\phi(x)^t\\phi(z)\\), where \\(\\phi(x) = x\\) polynomial kernel: \\(k(x, z) = (x^tz)^d\\) $(\"pre\").each(function (index, item) { $(item).html(\"<code>\" + $(item).html() + \"</code>\"); }); hljs.highlightall(); "

\\frac{1}{m} \\left\\{ \\sum_{j=1}^m \\sum_{i=1}^c [y_{ij}\\cdot \\log(h_\\theta(x_j)_i)] + [(1-y_{ij})\\cdot \\log(1-(h_\\theta(x_j)_i))]\\right\\} \\end{align} el primer sumatorio que va de 1 a \\(m\\) se encarga de calcular el coste para cada ejemplo \\(j\\). mientras que el segundo sumatorio, que va de 1 a \\(c\\), se encarga de calcular el coste para cada nodo de salida. esta funciÃ³n se aplica sobre los \\(k\\) nodos en la capa de salida. ejemplo cÃ¡lculo funciÃ³n de coste regularizaciÃ³n definimos la funciÃ³n de coste introduciendo regularizaciÃ³n como sigue: \\begin{align} j(\\theta) = - \\frac{1}{m} \\left\\{ \\sum_{j=1}^m \\sum_{i=1}^c [y_{ij}\\cdot \\log(h_\\theta(x_j)_i)] + [(1-y_{ij})\\cdot \\log(1-(h_\\theta(x_j)_i))]\\right\\} + \\frac{\\lambda}{2m} \\sum_{q=1}^k \\sum_{i=1}^{s_q}\\sum_{j=1}^{s_{q+1}} (\\theta_{ji}^{(q)})^2 \\end{align} antes de nada, recordar que \\(s_q\\) denota el nÃºmero de nodos en la capa \\(q\\). entonces, el primer tÃ©rmino de la funciÃ³n es igual que cuando no se aplicaba regularizaciÃ³n. expliquemos el segundo tÃ©rmino. la regularizaciÃ³n, en este caso, consiste en sumar todos los pesos de la red neuronal, por lo tanto: por cada capa \\(q\\), con \\(1 \\leq q \\leq k\\), sumamos todos los elementos de la matriz de pesos \\(\\theta^{q}\\), que como sabemos tiene dimensiones \\(s_{q} \\times s_{q-1}\\) dada la matriz \\(\\theta^{(q)}\\) recorremos cada columna \\(i\\), con \\(1 \\leq i \\leq s_{q-1}\\) recorremos cada elemento \\(j\\) de la columna \\(i\\), con \\(1 \\leq j \\leq s_{q}\\) sumamos al total cada elemento de la matriz \\(\\theta^{(q)}_{ji}\\) una vez se han sumado todas las matrices de pesos obtenemos un escalar, que multiplicamos por \\(\\frac{\\lambda}{2m}\\) mÃºltiple ejemplos la salida de cada capa \\(q\\) es una matriz \\(s_q \\times m\\), donde \\(s_q\\) denota el nÃºmero de nodos en la capa \\(q\\) y \\(m\\) denota el nÃºmero de ejemplos. como vimos en nuestras figuras, donde se presentaban los cÃ¡lculos sÃ³lo para un ejemplo, en cada capa \\(q\\) podemos mapear la salida de los \\(s_q\\) nodos a un vector columna \\(s_q \\times 1\\). si generalizamos esto a \\(m\\) ejemplos tenemos que la salida de cada capa es una matriz \\(s_q \\times m\\). esto se ilustra en la siguiente imagen: retropropagaciÃ³n vamos, ahora a explicar cÃ³mo se aplica la retropropagaciÃ³n. lo primero que debemos tener en cuenta es que este proceso se basa en la misma idea de optimizaciÃ³n que la regresiÃ³n lineal y la regresiÃ³n logÃ­stica, es decir, lo que queremos hacer es minimizar el coste, \\(j(\\theta)\\) sea \\(c\\) el nÃºmero de nodos en la Ãºltima capa, \\(\\theta_{it}\\) el peso \\(t\\) del nodo \\(i\\) de la Ãºltima capa \\(k\\), \\(a_{ij}^{(k)}\\) la salida del nodo \\(i\\) para el ejemplo \\(j\\) en la capa \\(k\\): calculamos el gradiente de la Ãºltima capa \\(k\\) como: \\(\\frac{\\delta j(\\theta)}{\\delta \\theta_{it}^{(k)}} = \\frac{\\delta j(\\theta)}{\\delta a_{1j}^{(k)}}\\frac{\\delta a_{1j}^{(k)}}{\\delta \\theta_{it}^{(k)}}\\) calculamos el gradiente en capas intermedias utilizando la regla de la cadena como: \\(\\frac{\\delta j(\\theta)}{\\delta \\theta_{it}^{(q)}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{s_{(q+1)}} \\frac{\\delta j(\\theta)}{\\delta a_{ij}^{(q+1)}}\\frac{\\delta a_{ij}^{(q+1)}}{\\delta a_{ij}^{(q)}}\\frac{\\delta a_{ij}^{(q)}}{\\delta \\theta_{it}^{(q)}}\\) normalmente en las capas intermedias, \\(q\\), nos referimos al tÃ©rmino \\(\\frac{\\delta j(\\theta)}{\\delta a_{ij}^{(q+1)}}\\) como \\(\\delta^{(q+1)}_{ij}\\). explicaciÃ³n de la retropropagaciÃ³n derivada de la funciÃ³n de coste a continuaciÃ³n explicamos cÃ³mo derivar la funciÃ³n de coste (paso 1). derivada de la funciÃ³n de coste capas intermedias veamos, ahora, cÃ³mo llevar a cabo el paso 2: Â¿cÃ³mo calculamos el gradiente (o lo que contribuye el peso \\(it\\) en el error) para los pesos de las capas intermedias?, es decir, cÃ³mo calculamos: \\[%align \\frac{\\delta j(\\theta)}{\\delta \\theta_{it}^{(q)}} \\] derivadas capas intermedias ejemplo de retropropagaciÃ³n ejemplo de retropropagaciÃ³n algoritmo partes del algoritmo en python notaciÃ³n Ã©poca: iteraciÃ³n en el entrenamiento pesos (\\(w_j^k, b_j^k\\)): se inicializan de forma aletoria (evitar simetrÃ­a) y con valores bajos. criterios de finalizaciÃ³n \\(j\\) o gradiente de \\(j\\) inferior a un umbral nÃºmero mÃ¡ximo de Ã©pocas velocidad de apredizaje \\(\\mu\\) intermedia: evita lentitud en las oscilaciones caÃ­da en mÃ­nimos locales que pueden tener \\(j\\) elevado. es por ello que se ejecuta varias veces el entrenamiento y se selecciona aquel que obtenga mejor resultado. actualizaciÃ³n de pesos patrÃ³n a patrÃ³n en lugar de tras computar el error sobre todo el dataset. puede evitar mÃ­nimos locales y converge antes. funciÃ³n de activaciÃ³n sigmoide para clasificaciÃ³n o linear para regresiÃ³n pseudocÃ³digo $(\"pre\").each(function (index, item) { $(item).html(\"<code>\" + $(item).html() + \"</code>\"); }); hljs.highlightall(); "

\\begin{align} \\frac{\\delta j_i}{\\delta b_j^k}=\\frac{\\delta j_i}{\\delta a_{ij}^k}\\frac{\\delta a_{ij}^k}{\\delta b_j^k} \\end{align} definimos: \\begin{align} \\delta_{ij}^k \\equiv \\frac{\\delta j_i}{\\delta a_{ij}^k} \\end{align} este indica el gradiente de la capa siguiente, para evitar tener que calcularlo. \\begin{align} \\frac{\\delta a_{ij}^k}{\\delta w_j^k} = h_i^{k-1} \\end{align} \\begin{align} \\frac{\\delta a_{ij}^k}{\\delta b_j^k} = 1 \\end{align} debido a que el valor de \\(a_{ij}^k\\) es la combinaciÃ³n lineal de la entradas y los pesos, donde las entradas son las salidas de la capa anterior (\\(k-1\\)), es decir \\(h_i^{k-1}\\), de tal manera que: \\begin{align} a_{ij}^k = (w_j^k)^th_i^{k-1}+b_j^k \\end{align} por lo que la derivada en funciÃ³n de

calcular es \\(\\delta_{ij}^k \\equiv \\frac{\\delta j_i}{\\delta a_{ij}^k}\\). tenemos que la funciÃ³n de coste para el patrÃ³n \\(i\\), \\(j_i\\) viene definida por: \\begin{align} j_i=\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{j=1}^{i_h}(y_{ij}-h_{ij}^h)^2=\\frac{|y_i-h_i^h|^2}{2} \\end{align} ademÃ¡s el valor de \\(a_{ij}^k\\), que es la combinaciÃ³n lineal de las entradas (salidas de las neuronas capa anterior, \\(k-1\\)) y los pesos junto con el offset: \\begin{align} a_{ij}^k=(w_j^k)^th_i^{k-1}+b_j^k \\end{align} por lo tanto en la capa final: \\begin{align} \\frac{\\delta j_i}{\\delta a_{ij}^h}=\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\delta (y_{ij}-h_{ij}^h)^2}{\\delta (y_{ij}-h_{ij}^h)}\\frac{\\delta (y_{ij}-h_{ij}^h)}{\\delta a_{ij}^h} \\end{align} donde: \\begin{align} \\frac{\\delta (y_{ij}-h_{ij}^h)^2}{\\delta (y_{ij}-h_{ij}^h)}=2(y_{ij}-h_{ij}^h) \\end{align} \\begin{align} \\frac{\\delta (y_{ij}-h_{ij}^h)}{\\delta a_{ij}^h}=\\frac{\\delta y_{ij}}{\\delta a_{ij}^h}-\\frac{\\delta h_{ij}^h}{\\delta a_{ij}^h}=0-f'(a_{ij}^h) \\end{align} ya que sabemos que \\(h_{ij}^h=f(a_{ij}^h)\\), por lo que: \\begin{align} \\frac{\\delta h_{ij}^h}{\\delta a_{ij}^h}=\\frac{\\delta f(a_{ij}^h)}{\\delta a_{ij}^h}=f'(a_{ij}^h) \\end{align} una vez desarrollado todo esto sustiuimos los resultados en \\(\\frac{\\delta j_i}{\\delta a_{ij}^h}\\): \\begin{align} \\frac{\\delta j_i}{\\delta a_{ij}^h}=\\frac{1}{2}2(y_{ij}-h_{ij}^h)(-f'(a_{ij}^h))=(y_{ij}-h_{ij}^h)f'(a_{ij}^h) \\end{align} de tal forma que: \\begin{align} \\delta_{ij}^h=\\frac{\\delta j_i}{\\delta a_{ij}^h}=(y_{ij}-h_{ij}^h)f'(a_{ij}^h)=\\epsilon_{ij}^hf'(a_{ij}^h) \\end{align} donde se define \\(\\epsilon_{ij}^h\\) como: \\begin{align} \\epsilon_{ij}^h=y_{ij}-h_{ij}^h \\end{align} finalmente obtenemos que el antigradiente en la Ãºltima capa \\(h\\) viene dado por: \\begin{align} \\delta w_j^h=-\\mu \\sum_{i=1}^n\\delta_{ij}^hh_i^{h-1}=-\\mu\\sum_{i=1}^n\\epsilon_{ij}^hf'(a_{ij}^h)h_i^{h-1} \\end{align} \\begin{align} \\delta b_j^h=-\\mu \\sum_{i=1}^n\\delta_{ij}^h=-\\mu\\sum_{i=1}^n\\epsilon_{ij}^hf'(a_{ij}^h) \\end{align} retropropagaciÃ³n del gradiente para las capas anteriores a la capa de salida (\\(k<h\\)): \\begin{align} \\delta_{ij}^k=\\frac{\\delta j_i}{\\delta a_{ij}^k}=\\sum_{l=1}^{i_{k+1}}\\frac{\\delta j_i}{\\delta a_{il}^{k+1}}\\frac{\\delta a_{il}^{k+1}}{\\delta a_{ij}^k}=\\sum_{l=1}^{i_{k+1}}\\delta_{il}^{k+1}\\frac{\\delta a_{il}^{k+1}}{\\delta a_{ij}^k} \\end{align} en este caso se utiliza la regla de la cadena para obtener \\(\\delta_{ij}^k\\) de modo que se tienen en cuenta todas las combinaciones del gradiente acumulado \\(\\delta a_{il}^{k+1}\\) con la neurona actual (\\(\\delta a_{ij}^k\\)) donde \\(l=1...i_{k+1}\\), es decir se tienen encuenta todas las neuronas de la capa siguiente. con grafos, la regla de la cadena se puede interpretar como todos los caminos posibles desde la capa de salida hasta la neurona \\(j\\) en la capa \\(k\\). cada camino une cada neurona \\(l\\) de la capa siguiente: \\(\\delta_{il}^{k+1}\\) (el cual ya tiene el gradiente acumulado de las capas siguientes) con una neurona \\(j\\) de la capa actual: \\(\\delta a_{ij}^k\\) de la siguiente forma: \\(\\delta_{il}^{k+1}\\frac{\\delta a_{il}^{k+1}}{\\delta a_{ij}^k}\\). ademÃ¡s se suman todas las combinaciÃ³n posibles: \\(\\sum_{l=1}^{i_{k+1}}\\). esto nos permite utilizar el gradiente acumulado calculado en la capa siguiente que se propaga hacia atrÃ¡s en la red neuronal, lo que evita tener que calcular \\(\\frac{\\delta j_i}{\\delta a_{ij}^k}\\). por otro lado tenemos: \\begin{align} a_{il}^{k+1}=(w_l^{k+1})^th_i^{k}+b_l^{k+1} \\end{align} que es el cÃ¡lculo de la neurona \\(l\\) de la capa siguiente, por lo que utiliza como entradas las salidas de la neurona de esta capa \\(h_i^{k}\\). esta es la versiÃ³n vectorizada del cÃ¡lculo, si lo expresamos como sumatorio: \\begin{align} a_{il}^{k+1}=\\sum_{m=1}^{i_k}w_{lm}^{k+1}h_{im}^{k}+b_{lm}^{k+1}=\\sum_{m=1}^{i_k}w_{lm}^{k+1}f(a_{im}^{k})+b_{lm}^{k+1} \\end{align} de tal forma que se multiplican los \\(i_k\\) pesos de la capa siguiente (\\(w_{lm}^{k+1}\\)) con las \\(i_k\\) salidas de la capa actual (\\(h_{im}^{k}\\)) y sumamos los offset (\\(b_{lm}^{k+1}\\)). ademÃ¡s sabemos que \\(h_{im}^{k}=f(a_{im}^{k})\\). por lo tanto: \\begin{align} \\frac{\\delta a_{il}^{k+1}}{\\delta a_{ij}^k}=\\sum_{m=1}^{i_k}(\\frac{\\delta(w_{lm}^{k+1}f(a_{im}^{k}))}{\\delta a_{ij}^k}+\\frac{\\delta b_{lm}^{k+1}}{\\delta a_{ij}^k}) \\end{align} la primera derivada tiene la siguiente forma: \\begin{align} \\frac{\\delta(w_{lm}^{k+1}f(a_{im}^{k}))}{\\delta a_{ij}^k}=w_{lm}^{k+1}\\frac{\\delta f(a_{im}^{k})}{\\delta a_{ij}^k} \\end{align} \\begin{align} \\frac{\\delta f(a_{im}^{k})}{\\delta a_{ij}^k} =\\begin{cases} f'(a^k_{im})=f'(a^k_{ij}) & m=j\\\\ 0 & m \\ne j \\end{cases} \\end{align} por lo que podemos eliminar el sumatorio sobre \\(m\\) y la derivada sobre el offset ya que su valor es nulo: \\begin{align} \\frac{\\delta a_{il}^{k+1}}{\\delta a_{ij}^k}=w_{lj}^{k+1}f'(a^k_{ij}) + 0 \\end{align} gradiente acumulado si volvemos a \\(\\delta_{ij}^k=\\frac{\\delta j_i}{\\delta a_{ij}^k}=\\sum_{l=1}^{i_{k+1}}\\delta_{il}^{k+1}\\frac{\\delta a_{il}^{k+1}}{\\delta a_{ij}^k}\\). sustituimos \\(\\frac{\\delta a_{il}^{k+1}}{\\delta a_{ij}^k}\\) obteniendo: \\begin{align} \\delta_{ij}^k=\\frac{\\delta j_i}{\\delta a_{ij}^k}=\\sum_{l=1}^{i_{k+1}}\\delta_{il}^{k+1}w_{lj}^{k+1}f'(a^k_{ij}) \\end{align} podemos extraer \\(f'(a^k_{ij})\\) ya que esta no depende de \\(l\\): \\begin{align} \\delta_{ij}^k=f'(a^k_{ij})\\sum_{l=1}^{i_{k+1}}\\delta_{il}^{k+1}w_{lj}^{k+1} \\end{align} si definimos: \\begin{align} \\epsilon_{ij}^k=\\sum_{l=1}^{i_{k+1}}\\delta_{il}^{k+1}w_{lj}^{k+1} \\end{align} tenemos que: \\begin{align} \\delta_{ij}^k=f'(a^k_{ij})\\epsilon_{ij}^k \\end{align} derivadas de las funciones de

    "body": " index search search back neural networks architecture algorithm output layer forward propagation parameters outputs graphical representation optimization problem loss function optimization back-propagation vectorization improving a neural network activation functions initialization techniques anexo architecture input: given any input \\(x\\) the first thing we do is flatten it. for example if \\(x\\) is a rgb image of \\(64 \\times 64\\), then \\(x \\in \\mathbb{r}^{64 \\times 64 \\times 3}\\) (for each of the \\(64 \\times 64\\) pixels we have three color channels: red, green, blue), is flattened into a vector in \\(\\mathbb{r}^{(64*64*3) \\times 1}\\) neuron: is an operation that has two parts: linear part: we denote the linear part like \\(z^{[i]}\\), where \\(i\\) is the current layer. activation part layer: a layer is a compound of neurons that are not connected with each other. algorithm the principal steps of the algorithm are: initialize the weights \\(w\\) and biases \\(b\\) randomly find the optimal \\(w, b\\) use the optimized \\(w, b\\) to predict the output by using the formula \\(\\hat{y} = \\sigma(wx +b)\\) output layer sigmoid the output layer will be different depending on the problem we are tackling. for example if we want to discriminate between 3 classes then the output layer could be as follows: so now the output is a vector \\(\\hat{y} \\in \\mathbb{r}^{c \\times 1}\\) where \\(c\\) is the number of classes. softmax the previous classifier allows for outputting multiples classes in the result, that is we can obtain a predicted output of the form \\(\\hat{y} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}\\). what if we want to add a constraint such that only one class can be predicted. then we use the softmax function as the activation function on the output layer: thus, instead of a probability for each class what we obtain is a probability distribution for all the classes. relu on linear regression we do not want the activation function to be linear, because then the whole network becomes a very large linear regression. instead we use as an activation function the relu function (rectified linear unit), whose output is zero if the input value is negative and linear otherwise. loss function the loss function when using the sigmoid function on the output layer is as follows: \\begin{align} \\mathcal{l} = - \\frac{1}{q} \\sum_{k=1}^q [y^{(k)} \\log(\\hat{y}^{(k)}) + (1- y^{(k)})\\log(1-\\hat{y}^{(k)})] \\end{align} where \\(\\hat{y}^{(k)}\\) are the predicted values and \\(q\\) is the total number of neurons on the output layer. however, if we use the softmax function as the activation function on the last layer we have to use a different derivative because this function does depend on the outputs of the other neurons. thus, we make use of a function called cross entropy loss: \\begin{align} \\mathcal{l}_{ce} = - \\sum_{k=1}^q y^{(k)} \\log(\\hat{y}^{(k)}) \\end{align} for linear regression we use as the loss function the l1-norm or the l2-norm. the latter is defined as follows: \\begin{align} \\mathcal{l} = || \\hat{y} - y ||_2^2 \\end{align} forward propagation the forward propagation equations are the following: \\begin{align} z^{[i]} = w^{[i]} a^{[i-1]} + b^{[i]} \\tag{1} \\end{align} where \\(i\\) is the layer with \\(i \\geq 1\\), and the first layer equals the input matrix, that is \\(a^{[0]} = x\\). by applying the activation function over \\((1)\\): \\begin{align} a^{[i]} = g(z^{[i]}) \\end{align} where \\(g\\) is the activation function (e.g \\(\\sigma(z^{[i]})\\)). now, what are the shapes of these matrices? \\(z^{[i]} \\in \\mathbb{r}^{s_i \\times m}\\) \\(a^{[i]} \\in \\mathbb{r}^{s_i \\times m}\\) where \\(s_i\\) is the number of neurons on the ith layer and \\(m\\) is the number of examples. note that the shape of the final layer changes depending on the task. so if \\(k\\) is the number of layers: in linear regression: \\(\\hat{y} = a^{[k]} \\in \\mathbb{r}^{1 \\times m}\\) in multi-class classification: \\(\\hat{y} = a^{[k]} \\in \\mathbb{r}^{c \\times m}\\), where \\(c\\) is the number of classes. also the shape of the weights are \\(w[i] \\in \\mathbb{r}^{s_i \\times s_{i-1}}\\), that is, this matrix is compatible with the outputs of the previous layer (\\(a^{[i-1]} \\in \\mathbb{r}^{s_{i-1} \\times m}\\)) and the linear part of the next layer (\\(z^{[i]} \\in \\mathbb{r}^{s^i \\times m}\\)). however, the bias are \\(b^{[i]} \\in \\mathbb{r}^{s^i \\times 1}\\), therefore we cannot perform an element wise summation because the shape of \\((w^{[i]} a^{[i-1]}) \\in \\mathbb{r}^{s_i \\times m}\\) and \\(b^{[i]}\\) are not compatible. to avoid this problem we apply a technique called broadcasting to \\(b\\), such that we replicate \\(b^{[i]}\\) \\(m\\) times: \\begin{align} \\hat{b}^{[i]} = \\begin{bmatrix} | & | & \\cdots & | \\\\ b^{[i]} & b^{[i]} & \\cdots & b^{[i]} \\\\ | & | & \\cdots & | \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\in \\mathbb{r}^{s_i \\times m} \\end{align} to sum up, the shapes of the data and the parameters on each layer \\(i\\) are: parameters \\begin{align} \\hat{b}^{[i]} = \\begin{bmatrix} | & | & \\cdots & | \\\\ b^{[i]} & b^{[i]} & \\cdots & b^{[i]} \\\\ | & | & \\cdots & | \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\in \\mathbb{r}^{s_i \\times m} \\end{align} \\begin{align} w^{[i]} = \\begin{bmatrix} | & | & \\cdots & | \\\\ w^{[i](1)} & w^{[i](2)} & \\cdots & w^{[i](s_{i-1})} \\\\ | & | & \\cdots & | \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\in \\mathbb{r}^{s_i \\times s_{i-1}} \\end{align} outputs note that for each example \\(j\\) on layer \\(i\\) \\(z^{[i](j)} = (w^{[i]} a^{[i-1](j)} + \\hat{b}^{[i]})\\), then: \\begin{align} z^{[i]} = \\begin{bmatrix} | & | & \\cdots & | \\\\ z^{[i](1)} & z^{[i](2)} & \\cdots & z^{[i](m)} \\\\ | & | & \\cdots & | \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\in \\mathbb{r}^{s_i \\times m} \\end{align} \\begin{align} a^{[i]} = \\begin{bmatrix} | & | & \\cdots & | \\\\ g(z^{[i](1)}) & g(z^{[i](2)}) & \\cdots & g(z^{[i](m)}) \\\\ | & | & \\cdots & | \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\in \\mathbb{r}^{s_i \\times m} \\end{align} graphical representation now we present a small example of how forward propagation works on neural networks: optimization problem what we want to do is find the parameters \\(w^{[i]}, b^{[i]}\\) for each layer \\(i\\) that minimize the cost. loss function so first of all we define a cost function for the objective \\(\\mathcal{l}(\\hat{y}, y)\\), where \\(\\hat{y}\\) is the predicted output and \\(y\\) is the real output. the cost function will depend on the type of problem (classification, regression). optimization the we optimize the loss function we defined by using backward propagation. for each layer \\(l=1, \\cdots, k\\), where \\(k\\) is the number of layers, we apply batch gradient descent (not mandatory, but here it is convenient as we can vectorize the derivatives) as follows: \\begin{align} w^{[l]} = w^{[l]} - \\alpha \\frac{\\delta \\mathcal{l}(\\hat{y}, y)}{\\delta w^{[l]}} \\end{align} \\begin{align} b^{[l]} = b^{[l]} - \\alpha \\frac{\\delta \\mathcal{l}(\\hat{y}, y)}{\\delta b^{[l]}} \\end{align} back-propagation to compute the derivatives of the cost function with respect to \\(w^{[l]}\\) and \\(b^{[l]}\\) we use the chain rule. output layer suppose we have \\(k\\) layers, then we start by calculating \\(\\frac{\\delta \\mathcal{l}(\\hat{y}, y)}{\\delta w^{[k]}}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\delta \\mathcal{l}(\\hat{y}, y)}{\\delta b^{[k]}}\\), that is, the derivatives on the last layer. thus, to update \\(w^{[k]}\\) (we apply the same logic for \\(b^{[k]}\\)): \\begin{align} \\frac{\\delta \\mathcal{l}(\\hat{y}, y)}{\\delta w^{[k]}} = \\sum_{i=1}^m \\frac{\\delta \\mathcal{l}(\\hat{y^{(i)}}, y^{(i)})}{\\delta w^{[k]}} = \\end{align} because \\(\\hat{y^{(i)}} = (a^{[k]})^{(i)}\\): \\begin{align} = \\sum_{i=1}^m \\frac{\\delta \\mathcal{l}((a^{[k]})^{(i)}, y^{(i)})}{\\delta w^{[k]}} \\end{align} we apply the chain rule on the derivative, therefore: \\begin{align} = \\sum_{i=1}^m \\frac{\\delta \\mathcal{l}((a^{[k]})^{(i)}, y^{(i)})}{\\delta (a^{[k]})^{(i)}} \\frac{\\delta (a^{[k]})^{(i)}}{\\delta w^{[k]}} \\end{align} because \\((a^{[k]})^{(i)} = g((z^{[k]})^{(i)})\\), where \\(g\\) is the activation function: \\begin{align} = \\sum_{i=1}^m \\frac{\\delta \\mathcal{l}((a^{[k]})^{(i)}, y^{(i)})}{\\delta (a^{[k]})^{(i)}} \\frac{\\delta g((z^{[k]})^{(i)})}{\\delta w^{[k]}} \\end{align} we apply the chain rule on the last derivative, therefore:

\\frac{\\delta \\mathcal{l}(\\hat{y^{(i)}}, y^{(i)})}{\\delta w^{[k-1]}} = \\end{align} because \\(\\hat{y^{(i)}} = (a^{[k]})^{(i)}\\): \\begin{align} = \\sum_{i=1}^m \\frac{\\delta

the activation function: \\begin{align} = \\sum_{i=1}^m \\frac{\\delta \\mathcal{l}((a^{[k]})^{(i)}, y^{(i)})}{\\delta (a^{[k]})^{(i)}} \\frac{\\delta g((z^{[k]})^{(i)})}{\\delta w^{[k-1]}}

the same as the derivatives on the layer \\(k\\), let's denote \\((\\delta^{[k]})^{(i)} = \\frac{\\delta \\mathcal{l}((a^{[k]})^{(i)}, y^{(i)})}{\\delta (a^{[k]})^{(i)}} \\frac{\\delta (a^{[k]})^{(i)}}{\\delta (z^{[k]})^{(i)}}\\) the accumulated gradient on layer \\(k\\) for example \\(i\\), then: \\begin{align} = \\sum_{i=1}^m (\\delta^{[k]})^{(i)} \\frac{\\delta

w^{[k-1]}}\\) graphical representation on the following image we show how to obtain the gradient of the first element of the first layer's first neuron's weights \\(w^{[1]}_{11}\\) on the first layer: improving a neural network activation functions why do we need activation functions? well, suppose you have the following network where the activation function is the identity function. that is \\(a^{[i]} = g(z^{[i]}) = z^{[i]}\\): then: \\begin{align} \\hat{y} = a^{[3]} = z^{[3]} = w^{[3]} a^{[2]} + b^{[3]} = w^{[3]} z^{[2]} + b^{[3]} = w^{[3]} (w^{[2]} a^{[1]} + b^{[2]}) + b^{[3]} \\end{align} \\begin{align} = w^{[3]} (w^{[2]} z^{[1]} + b^{[2]}) + b^{[3]} = w^{[3]} (w^{[2]} (w^{[1]} x + b^{[1]}) + b^{[2]}) + b^{[3]} \\end{align} \\begin{align} = w^{[3]} (w^{[2]} w^{[1]} x + w^{[2]} b^{[1]} + b^{[2]}) + b^{[3]} \\end{align} \\begin{align} = w^{[3]} w^{[2]} w^{[1]} x + w^{[3]} w^{[2]} b^{[1]} + w^{[3]} b^{[2]} + b^{[3]} \\end{align} if \\begin{align} w = w^{[3]} w^{[2]} w^{[1]} \\end{align} \\begin{align} b = w^{[3]} w^{[2]} b^{[1]} + w^{[3]} b^{[2]} + b^{[3]} \\end{align} then: \\begin{align} \\hat{y} = wx + b \\end{align} as you can see if we do not use activation functions, it does not mater how deep your network is, it is going to be equivalent to a linear regression. depending on the task at hand we use different activation functions: sigmoid: \\(\\sigma(z) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}\\), it maps \\(z \\in (-\\infty, \\infty)\\) to \\((0, 1)\\) it is good for classification works well when the values are in the linear region of the function however when the values are on the extremes the gradient (slope) is very small, therefore it ends up vanishing in the network. relu: \\(relu(z) = \\begin{cases}0 & z \\leq 0 \\\\ 1 & z > 0\\end{cases}\\) tanh: \\(tanh(z) = \\frac{e^z - e^{-z}}{(e^z + e^{-z})}\\) initialization techniques usually we normalize the input to avoid having saturated activation functions. to normalize: \\begin{align} x^{(i)}_j = \\frac{x^{(i)}_j - \\mu_j}{\\sigma_j} \\end{align} for every example \\(i\\) and feature \\(j\\). where: \\(\\mu_j\\) is the mean of the \\(j\\) feature, thus: \\(\\mu_j = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^m x^{(i)}_j\\) \\(\\sigma_j^2\\) is the variance of the \\(j\\) feature, thus: \\(\\sigma_j^2 = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^m (x^{(i)}_j - \\mu_j)^2\\) vanishing/exploding gradients suppose you have the following network, where the activation function is the identity function and \\(b=0\\). then \\(\\hat{y} = w^{[l]} a^{[l-1]} = w^{[l]} w^{[l-1]} a^{[l-2]} = \\cdots = w^{[l]} w^{[l-1]} \\cdots w^{[1]} x\\) therefore, if: \\begin{align} w^{[l]} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1.5 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1.5 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\end{align} then: \\begin{align} \\hat{y} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1.5^l & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1.5^l \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\end{align} which means we end up with an exploding gradient. the inverse happens when: \\begin{align} w^{[l]} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0.5 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0.5 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\end{align} then: \\begin{align} \\hat{y} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0.5^l & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0.5^l \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\end{align} which results in a vanishing gradient. to avoid this somewhat, we need to initialize the weights properly. what we want is for the weights to be very close to one to avoid the exploding/diminishing problem. intuition given a single neuron: then \\(a = g(z)\\) and \\(z = w_1 x_1 + \\cdots + w_n x_n\\). we can see that \\(z\\) will increase if \\(n\\) increases, therefore we would want \\(w_i\\) to be as small as \\(n\\) is large, that is: \\begin{align} w_i = \\frac{1}{n} \\end{align} initialization techniques if we want the value of \\(w^{[l]}\\) to be proportional to the number of inputs coming from the layer \\(l\\) (\\(n^{[l-1]}\\)). it works very well for sigmoid activation: w[k] = np.random.randn(shape)*np.sqrt(1/n[l-1]) for relu: w[k] = np.random.randn(shape)*np.sqrt(2/n[l-1]) xavier initialization (used with tanh): \\(w^{[l]} \\sim \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n^{[l-1]}}}\\) her initialization: \\(w^{[l]} \\sim \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n^{[l]} + n^{[l-1]}}}\\) also you need to initialize the weights randomly, else you will run into the symmetry problem, where all neurons learn the same thing (that is they update very similarly). optimization mini batch gradient descent mini batch gradient descent is a trade off between batch gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent. also, because mini batch gradient descent is an approximation it introduces some noise on the loss function: however mini batch gradient descent is more used because batch gradient descent can be very computationally expensive. momentum algorithm this algorithm combines gradient descent and momentum. suppose you have the following contour plot, where the horizontal axis is much more extended that the vertical axis. by default on gradient descent the gradient of the loss will be orthogonal to the contour at the given point, as we can see: however, what we would like, so it would converge faster, is to make it move more horizontally than vertically. in order to do that we use a technique called momentum. it takes intro account past updates to find the right way to go. if you take an average of past updates, then: vertical axis: it practically cancels itself because it oscillates a lot horizontal axis: its value it's maintained because the past and present gradients go in the same direction to update the weights we apply the following equation: \\begin{align} \\upsilon = \\beta \\upsilon + (1 - \\beta) \\frac{\\delta \\mathcal{l}(\\hat{y}, y)}{\\delta w} \\end{align} where: \\(\\upsilon\\): stores past updates \\(\\frac{\\delta \\mathcal{l}(\\hat{y}, y)}{\\delta w}\\): stores the current update we average with \\(\\beta\\) and \\((1 - \\beta)\\) finally we update the weights: \\begin{align} w = w - \\alpha \\upsilon \\end{align} anexo for more info about cost function and how to derive them: anexo $(\"pre\").each(function (index,

given examples \\(\\{x^{(i)}\\}_{i=1}^n\\) where \\(x^{(i)} \\in \\mathbb{r}^d\\), we want to find out if our data lives is a low dimensional space. look at the next example: we can see that the two features are correlated, and we can project the points onto a line, reducing the space from two dimensions to one. so it might be the case that some features are highly correlated, and so de d-dimensional space can be as a k-dimensional space where \\(0 < k < d\\): \\begin{align} \\begin{bmatrix} x_{11} & \\cdots & x_{1d} \\\\ \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ x_{n1} & \\cdots & x_{nd} \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\rightarrow \\begin{bmatrix} x_{11} & \\cdots & x_{1k} \\\\ \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ x_{n1} & \\cdots & x_{nk} \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\end{align} standardize data a lot of the times the units of each feature in the data make the values in one column (feature) be much bigger than the values in another column. thus, the first step is to standardize your data: center data have it have variance equal to one so we transform our data as follows: \\begin{align} x_j^{(i)} = \\frac{x_j^{(i)} - \\mu_j}{\\sigma_j} \\end{align} where: \\(u_j\\) is the mean of the feature \\(j\\) over the \\(n\\) examples, such that \\(u_j = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^nx^{(i)}_j\\) \\(\\sigma_j\\) is the standard deviation of the feature \\(j\\) over the \\(n\\) examples, where \\(\\sigma_j^2 = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n(x^{(i)}_j - \\mu_j)^2\\) pca find underlying space to reduce the dimensionality of our data we first define a subspace and then we project each point onto the subspace. this projection is the closes point in the subspace to the point we are trying to project, this has as a consequence that the \"line\" connecting the point to its projection is always perpendicular to the subspace: the goal is to choose the subspace that maximizes the variance of the projected points, to retain the maximum possible variance of the data. as you can see if we choose the blue line as the subspace the variance is much bigger that if we choose the red line: represent the subspace let us suppose the subspace is defined by a basis vector \\(u \\in \\mathbb{r}^d\\) where \\(u\\) is a unit vector, then projection of \\(\\overrightarrow{x^{(i)}}\\) on to the space spanned by \\(u\\) will be: \\begin{align} proj(u)\\overrightarrow{x^{(i)}} \\end{align} where \\(proj(u)\\) is the projection matrix and \\(x^{(i)} \\in \\mathbb{r}^d\\). so, because \\(proj(u) = \\frac{uu^t}{u^tu}\\), then the projected point is defined as: \\begin{align} proj(u)\\overrightarrow{x^{(i)}} = \\frac{uu^t}{u^tu} \\overrightarrow{x^{(i)}} = ((x^{(i)})^tu)u \\end{align} where \\(((x^{(i)})^tu)\\) is an scalar. so, now our goal is to find a \\(u\\) that maximizes the variance across the \\(n\\) examples. that is, we want to maximize the sum of the square of the norms of the projected points: more formally: \\begin{align} u = \\underset{u}{\\arg \\max} \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n ||proj(u)x^{(i)}||^2 = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n ||((x^{(i)})^tu)u||^2 \\end{align} because the norm of a unit vector multiplied by a scalar is just the square of the scalar (for \\(3 \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\): \\(||\\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}|| = (\\sqrt{3^2 + 0^2 + 0^2})^2 = 3^2\\)): \\begin{align} u = \\underset{u}{\\arg \\max} \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n ((x^{(i)})^tu)^2 = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n ((x^{(i)})^tu)^t((x^{(i)})^tu) = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n u^t x^{(i)} (x^{(i)})^t u \\end{align} because \\(u, u^t\\) are a common factor in the sum: \\begin{align} u = \\underset{u}{\\arg \\max} \\left[u^t \\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n x^{(i)} (x^{(i)})^t \\right) u\\right] \\end{align} now, we know that given the optimization problem of the form \\(\\underset{u}{\\arg \\max} \\left[u^t a u\\right]\\), the solution \\(u\\) is the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of \\(a\\). in this scenario, \\(a = \\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n x^{(i)} (x^{(i)})^t \\right)\\), which equals the sample covariance matrix, which is defined as: \\begin{align} \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x^{(i)} - \\mu)^t (x^{(i)} - \\mu) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x^{(i)} - 0)^t (x^{(i)} - 0) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x^{(i)})^t x^{(i)} \\end{align} note that, because our data is now centered after standardizing it, the mean \\(\\mu\\) equals zero. hence, we want to calculate the eigenvectors of the sample covariance matrix of x. mind you, we have derived this solution for a space defined by only one vector \\(u\\). however given basis vectors \\((u_1, \\cdots, u_k)\\) the optimization problem holds and the solution are the \\(k\\) eigenvectors corresponding to the \\(k\\) largest eigenvalues of \\(a\\). algorithm layout the steps of pca are the following: calculate the sample covariance matrix as \\(x^tx\\) calculate the eigenvector and eigenvalues of \\(x^tx\\), such that: \\begin{align} \\begin{matrix} (\\lambda_1, u_1) \\\\ (\\lambda_2, u_2) \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ (\\lambda_d, u_d) \\\\ \\end{matrix} \\end{align} are the \\(d\\) eigenvectors (\\(u_i\\)) and eigenvalues (\\(\\lambda_i\\)). we assume the tuples are ordered in decreasing order with respect to the eigenvalues, such that if \\(i > j\\) then \\(\\lambda_i > \\lambda_j\\). find \\(k\\) such that we satisfy a confidence level with respect to the variance, i.e. suppose you want to preserve 95% of the variance of the original data then: \\begin{align} \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^k \\lambda_i}{\\sum_{j=1}^d \\lambda_j} = 95\\% \\end{align} choose the \\(k\\) eigenvectors with the largest corresponding eigenvalues. performing eigen-decomposition first of all, let us present two properties regarding eigen-decompositions of a matrix \\(x\\): if \\(x\\) is a square matrix and symmetric then \\(x\\) has orthogonal eigenvectors and real eigenvalues. if \\(x\\) is also positive semi-definite then the eigenvalues are positive. in our case, the eigen-decomposition is done over \\(x^tx\\), therefore this matrix is guaranteed to be a square matrix, symmetric and positive semi-definite. then, performing the eigen decomposition of \\(x^tx\\) is equivalent to performing singular value decomposition (svd) over \\(x\\), such that the single values equal the square root of the eigenvalues. large datasets to perform pca on large datasets we use a technique called power iteration, which consists on: for \\(i=0\\), initialize \\(u^{(i)}\\) to random values other than zero set \\(i = i+1\\), and \\(u^{(i)} = (x^tx)u^{(i-1)}\\) re-scale \\(u^{(i)}\\) to have unit length such that: \\(u^{(i)}=\\frac{(x^tx)u^{(i-1)}}{||(x^tx)u^{(i-1)}||}\\) go to step 2. eventually it will converge to the largest eigenvector. rephrasing pca another way to describe the problem solved by pca, equivalent to the maximization variance perspective, is: find a subspace such that the projection of the points are as close to the original data as possible, that is minimize the sum of the distances between the projected points and the original points. ica this algorithm pretends to solve what is commonly known as the source separation problem, where we are given a dataset \\(x\\) that is a mixture of some source data \\(s\\). we then use these mixed sources \\(x\\) to construct a unmixing matrix \\(w\\) to recover the source \\(s\\). intuition imagine there are \\(d\\) speakers and \\(d\\) microphones randomly distributed in a room, such that: \\(s \\in \\mathbb{r}^d\\) is the representation of what a speaker says. so \\(s_j^{(i)}\\) is what the \\(j\\) speaker said in moment \\(i\\). \\(x \\in \\mathbb{r}^d\\) is the representation of what a microphone records. so \\(x_j^{(i)}\\) is what the \\(j\\) microphone recorded in moment \\(i\\). for example, given two speaker, what they say is represented as follows: meanwhile the recordings of the microphones are the following: we are only given \\(x\\), and the goal is to recover the original speech signal spoken by each speaker. we assume that \\(x\\) is a linear combination of what each speaker says, thus \\(x = as\\), where \\(a\\) is a quare matrix \\(d \\times d\\) and is called the mixing matrix. what we want to do is to compute the inverse of \\(a\\), \\(w\\) such that \\(w = a^{-1}\\), where \\(w\\) is called the unmixing matrix. then: \\begin{align} a^{-1}x = a^{-1}as \\rightarrow a^{-1}x = s \\rightarrow wx = s \\rightarrow s = wx \\end{align} solution to solve this problem we make the following assumptions: the number of sources \\(s\\) are equal to the number of \"examples\" in the mixed dataset \\(x\\) \\(x\\) is a linear combination of \\(s\\), such that \\(s = wx\\) \\(s_j\\) is independent of \\(s_k\\), whenever \\(j \\neq k\\). that is to say, each belongs to a different probability distribution, and are two independent random variables. each \\(s_j\\) is not gaussian. intuition suppose we are given a random variable \\(x\\) such that \\(x ~ unif [0,1]\\), then the probability density function is: let us define a new distribution as follows \\(y=2x\\), then the probability density function is: note, that the function is \"stretched\" as to always satisfy the condition that the integral of \\(pdf\\) must equal 1, which is the same as saying the area under the function is 1. so now, \\(p_y (y) = p_x(x) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = p_x(\\frac{y}{2})\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}\\), because \\(x = \\frac{y}{2}\\). but what happens in a higher dimension? that is, what happens when we multiply \\(x \\in \\mathbb{r}^d\\) by a mixing matrix \\(w \\in \\mathbb{r}^{d \\times d}\\). well, given \\(y \\in \\mathbb{r}^{d \\times d}\\), such that \\(y=wx\\), then to perform a change of random variable we use the jacobian: \\begin{align} p_y(y) = p_x(x)\\frac{1}{|w|} = p_x(w^{-1}y)\\frac{1}{|w|} \\end{align} where \\(|w|\\) is the determinant of \\(w\\). first of all we define the distribution of the mixed dataset as follows: \\begin{align} p_x(x) = \\prod_{j=1}^d p_s (s_j) |w| = \\prod_{j=1}^d p_s (w_j^tx) |w| \\end{align} note that \\(s_j=(w_j)^tx\\). we also assume that \\(p_s\\) is distributed according to a logistic distribution, thus: cumulative distribution function (cdf): \\(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}} = \\sigma(x)\\) probability density function (pdf): \\(\\sigma(x)\\sigma(1-x)\\) so, we obtain the likelihood of \\(w\\) as follows: \\begin{align} l(w) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left[\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^d \\log[\\sigma(x^{(i)})(1-\\sigma(x^{(i)}))]\\right) + \\log{|w|}\\right] \\end{align} where \\(w\\) is the parameter we are trying to obtain. so, to solve the optimization problem: we define the maximization of the likelihood as the objective we compute the derivative of \\(l(w)\\) and perform gradient descent, such that the update step is as follows: \\begin{align} w = w - \\alpha \\left\\{\\begin{bmatrix} (1- 2\\sigma(w_1^tx^{(i)})) \\\\ (1- 2\\sigma(w_2^tx^{(i)})) \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ (1- 2\\sigma(w_d^tx^{(i)})) \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} (x^{(i)})^t + (w^t)^{-1} \\right\\} \\end{align} $(\"pre\").each(function (index, item) {

    "body": " index search search back expectation maximization introduction gaussian mixture models em algorithm with gmm's e-step m-step optimal parameters of a gmm iterative process recap: anomaly detection generalized em algorithm jensen's inequality motivation e-step m-step putting everything together derive em for gmm e-step m-step introduction this technique is employed in density estimation problems and anomaly detection. such problems aim to represent data in a compact form using a statistical distribution, e.g., gaussian, beta, or gamma. you can think of those problems as a clustering task but from a probabilistic point of view. this is what makes the em algorithm a probabilistic generative model. thus, if we are given \\(n\\) samples, we model them with \\(p(x)\\), such that if \\(p(x) < \\epsilon\\), where \\(\\epsilon\\) is some threshold, then we detect an anomaly. however, you may expect that a single gaussian with its mean and variance cannot map thousands of instances in a dataset into a set of \\(k\\) clusters accurately, so we may assume that there are \\(k\\) distributions that describe the data, hence we use mixture models. for example, imagine you have the following dataset: it looks like the data comes from two different gaussian distributions: so to model this data we use a mixture of gaussian models. note that if we knew by which distribution each sample was generated, we would simply use mle, however we do not know this information, therefore we use the expectation maximization algorithm and we introduce the latent variable \\(z\\) in place of the predicted output \\(y\\) we had in supervised learning algorithms. to model the data, first of all, we suppose that there is a latent (hidden/unobserved) random variable \\(z\\), and \\(x^{(i)}, z^{(i)}\\) are distributed (by a joint distribution) like so \\begin{align} p(x^{(i)},z^{(i)}) = p(x^{(i)}|z^{(i)}) p(z^{(i)}) \\end{align} where \\(z^{(i)} \\sim multinomial(\\phi)\\), that is \\(z^{(i)}\\) is distributed according to a multinomial distribution. this distribution models for each \\(z^{(i)}\\) the probability of it being equal to \\(1, 2, ..., k\\), where \\(k\\) is the number of clusters. this will denote the probability of a point \\(x^{(i)}\\) being drawn from each of the distributions. and \\(p(x^{(i)}|z^{(i)}=j)\\) is the probability of \\(x^{(i)}\\) being generated by the cluster \\(j\\). where \\(x^{(i)}|z^{(i)} = j\\) is drawn from a normal distribution \\(\\mathcal{n}(\\mu_j, \\sigma_j)\\). gaussian mixture models to build a density estimator model, we cannot rely on a simple distribution. mixture models try to tackle this limitation by combining a set of distributions to create a convex space where we can search for the optimal parameters for such distributions using maximum likelihood estimation (mle). a mixture model is expressed by the following equations: \\begin{align} p(x^{(i)}) = \\sum_{j=1}^k \\phi^{(i)}_j p_j(x^{(i)}) \\tag{1} \\end{align} \\begin{align} 0 \\leq \\phi^{(i)}_j \\leq 1, \\sum_{j=1}^k \\phi^{(i)}_j = 1 \\end{align} where \\(k\\) is the number of mixture components (clusters), \\(\\phi^{(i)}_j\\)'s are the mixture weights, and \\(p_j(x^{(i)})\\)'s are members of a family of distributions (gaussian, poisson, bernoulli, etc). so for each example \\(x^{(i)}\\) and for each distribution \\(j\\), each weight \\(\\phi^{(i)}_j\\) is between 0 and 1, and the sum over \\(k\\) of the weights \\(\\phi_j^{(i)}\\) for every example \\(x^{(i)}\\) equals one. consequently, a gmm is a mixture model where the \\(p_j(x^{(i)})\\) is a finite combination of gaussian distributions. therefore, a gmm can be precisely defined by the following set of equations: \\begin{align} p(x^{(i)};\\theta) = \\sum_{j=1}^k \\phi^{(i)}_j \\mathcal{n}(x^{(i)};\\mu_j,\\,\\sigma_j) \\end{align} \\begin{align} 0 \\leq \\phi^{(i)}_j \\leq 1, \\sum_{j=1}^k \\phi^{(i)}_j = 1 \\end{align} where \\(\\theta\\) is the collection of all the parameters of the model (mixture weights, means, and covariance matrices): \\begin{align} \\theta = \\{\\phi_1, \\cdots, \\phi_k, \\mu_1, \\cdots, \\mu_k, \\sigma_1, \\cdots, \\sigma_k\\} \\end{align} for example, the following plot shows what a gmm derived from 3 mixture components looks like: as a consequence, for each data point, \\(x^{(i)}\\) (in red), we can compute the probability that it belongs to each component (\\(p(x^{(i)}|z^{(i)} = j)\\), where \\(j = 1, 2, 3\\))(make a âsoftâ assignment). this quantity is called âresponsibilityâ. em algorithm with gmm's the expectation maximization algorithm is comprised of two steps: guess the value of the responsibilities \\(w^{(i)}_j\\), that represent the \"amount\" of each \\(x^{(i)}\\) that was generated from the distribution \\(j\\) (or the probability that the \\(j\\)th distribution generated the point \\(x^{(i)}\\)). compute the values of the parameters of the distributions: \\(\\theta = \\{\\phi, \\mu, \\sigma\\}\\) according to the \\(mle\\) (maximum likelihood estimation) with respect to the parameters. thus, we want to maximize \\(\\mathcal{l}(\\phi, \\mu, \\sigma)\\). e-step in this step, as we have said, we will compute the value of the responsibilities with the given parameters \\(\\phi, \\mu, \\sigma\\). so for each example \\(i\\) and each component (distribution) \\(j\\), the amount of \\(x^{(i)}\\) that is generated by the component \\(j\\) is given by: \\begin{align} w^{(i)}_j = p(z^{(i)} = j | x^{(i)}; \\phi_j, \\mu_j, \\sigma_j) \\end{align} by bayes' rule, we can rewrite the equation as follows: \\begin{align} w^{(i)}_j = \\frac{p(x^{(i)}|z^{(i)} = j)p(z^{(i)} = j)}{\\sum_{l=1}^k \\left[p(x^{(i)}|z^{(i)} = l)p(z^{(i)} = l)\\right]} \\end{align} note that the likelihood \\(p(x^{(i)}|z^{(i)} = j)\\) and each likelihood \\(p(x^{(i)}|z^{(i)} = l)\\) come from a gaussian distribution, therefore: \\begin{align} p(x^{(i)}|z^{(i)} = j) = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^{\\frac{n}{2}}|\\sigma_j|^{\\frac{1}{2}}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}(x^{(i)} - \\mu_j)^t \\sigma_j^{-1} (x^{(i)} - \\mu_j)\\right) \\tag{2} \\end{align} to simplify notation we will denote \\(p(x^{(i)}|z^{(i)} = j)\\) as \\(\\mathcal{n}(\\mu_j, \\sigma_j)\\). on the other hand, the prior \\(p(z^{(i)} = j)\\) comes from a multinomial distribution, hence: \\begin{align} p(z^{(i)} = j) = \\phi_j \\tag{3} \\end{align} combining all the expressions: \\begin{align} w^{(i)}_j = \\frac{\\phi_j\\mathcal{n}(\\mu_j, \\sigma_j)}{\\sum_{l=1}^k \\left[\\phi_l\\mathcal{n}(\\mu_l, \\sigma_l)\\right]} \\tag{4} \\end{align} all that is left to do is plug all of the values into each equation \\((2)\\) and \\((3)\\) (this values are known, given the equations are written in terms of the distributions' parameters) and compute each \\(w^{(i)}_j\\) given \\((4)\\). m-step in this step what we do is maximize the log likelihood of the distributions' parameters \\(\\theta\\), that is we maximize \\(\\mathcal{l}(\\phi, \\mu, \\sigma)\\). but first, let us see how do we maximize the parameters in gmm. optimal parameters of a gmm we are going to show how to maximize the log likelihood of the parameters of a gaussian mixture model. the goal of the gmm is to represent the distribution of the data as accurately as possible using a linear combination of gaussian distributions. given a dataset \\(x\\) of \\(m\\) data points, we assume they are i.i.d (independent and identically distributed), therefore the maximum likelihood estimator over \\(x\\) can be expressed as the product of the individual likelihoods. to simplify the equations, we are going to directly apply the logarithm to the mle function: \\begin{align} \\log \\mathcal{l}(x|\\theta) = \\log p(x|\\theta) = \\log \\prod_{i=1}^m p(x^{(i)}|\\theta) = \\sum_{i=1}^m \\log p(x^{(i)}|\\theta) \\end{align} by \\((1)\\) we know that \\(p(x^{(i)}|\\theta)\\) is a linear combination of gaussian distributions, therefore: \\begin{align} \\log \\mathcal{l}(x|\\theta) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\log \\sum_{j=1}^k \\phi_j^{(i)}\\mathcal{n}(x^{(i)}|\\mu_j, \\sigma_j) \\end{align} this equation is not tractable, so we won't get an analytical solution by just taking the its derivative with respect to \\(\\theta\\) and setting it to 0. the following set of equations outline how we would evaluate it: \\begin{align} \\frac{\\delta \\mathcal{l}}{\\delta \\mu_j} \\sum_{i=1}^m \\frac{\\delta \\log p(x^{(i)}|\\theta)}{\\delta \\mu_j} = 0^t \\end{align} \\begin{align} \\frac{\\delta \\mathcal{l}}{\\delta \\sigma_j} \\sum_{i=1}^m \\frac{\\delta \\log p(x^{(i)}|\\theta)}{\\delta \\sigma_j} = 0 \\end{align} \\begin{align} \\frac{\\delta \\mathcal{l}}{\\delta \\phi_j} \\sum_{i=1}^m \\frac{\\delta \\log p(x^{(i)}|\\theta)}{\\delta \\phi_j} = 0 \\end{align} observe that the computation of each parameter from \\(\\theta (\\mu, \\sigma, \\phi)\\) depends on the other parameters in a complex way. to solve those equations, we can use the strategy of optimizing some parameters while keeping the others fixed. going back to the expectation maximization algorithm, there is a way of updating the individual parameters of a gmm given prior (initialized at random) parameters \\(\\mu, \\sigma, \\phi\\). this approach works by updating some parameters while keeping the others fixed. so, by solving the derivatives presented above we derive the three following updating rules: \\begin{align} \\hat{\\mu}_j = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^m w^{(i)}_jx^{(i)}}{\\sum_{l=1}^m w^{(l)}_j} \\end{align} \\begin{align} \\hat{\\sigma}_j = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^m w^{(i)}_j (x^{(i)} - \\hat{\\mu}_j)(x^{(i)} - \\hat{\\mu}_j)^t}{\\sum_{l=1}^m w^{(l)}_j} \\end{align} \\begin{align} \\hat{\\phi}_j = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^m w^{(i)}_j \\end{align} to simplify a bit the notation, if \\(n_j = \\sum_{l=1}^m w^{(i)}_l\\): \\begin{align} \\hat{\\mu}_j = \\frac{1}{n_j} \\sum_{i=1}^m w^{(i)}_jx^{(i)} \\end{align} \\begin{align} \\hat{\\sigma}_j = \\frac{1}{n_j}\\sum_{i=1}^m w^{(i)}_j (x^{(i)} - \\hat{\\mu}_j)(x^{(i)} - \\hat{\\mu}_j)^t \\end{align} \\begin{align} \\hat{\\phi}_j = \\frac{n_j}{m} \\end{align} note that the update of \\(\\mu, \\sigma, \\phi\\), all depend on the responsibilities (\\(w^{(i)}_j\\)), which by its turn, depends on \\(\\mu, \\sigma, \\phi\\). thatâs why there's not a closed-form solution to equations. furthermore these equations do not aim to precisely maximize over \\(\\theta\\) the actual log likelihood. instead they maximize a proxy function of the log-likelihood over \\(\\theta\\), namely, the expected log-likelihood, which can be derived from the log-likelihood using jensen's inequality as follows: \\begin{align} \\hat{\\mathcal{l}}(x|\\theta) = \\sum_{i=1}^m\\sum_{j=1}^k w^{(i)}_j \\log \\left( \\frac{\\phi_j \\mathcal{n}(x^{(i)} | \\mu_j, \\sigma_j)}{w^{(i)}_j} \\right) \\tag{5} \\end{align} iterative process the process consists of an iterative process that alternates between two steps. the first step is to compute the responsibilities (e step) of each mixture component for each data point using the current parameters (\\(\\mu, \\sigma, \\phi\\)). the second step consists of updating the parameters (m step) in order to maximize the expected log-likelihood given by \\((5)\\) the e and m steps are repeated until there is no significant progress in the proxy function of the log-likelihood computed after the m step. recap: anomaly detection thus, when the parameters \\(\\theta\\) are optimized, we can compute \\(p(x) = \\sum_{j=1}^k p(x|z = j)\\) and if \\(p(x) < \\epsilon\\) you can flag \\(x\\) as an anomaly. generalized em algorithm jensen's inequality convex function we are going to show what jensen's inequality is about. so: let \\(f\\) be a convex function (e.g. \\(f''(x) > 0\\)) and let \\(x\\) be a random variable, then \\begin{align} f(e[x]) \\leq e[f(x)] \\end{align} where \\(e\\) is the expected value. further, if \\(f''(x) > 0\\) (we say f is strictly convex, that is f is not a straight line), then: \\begin{align} e[f(x)] = f(e[x]) \\leftrightarrow \\text{ x is a constant, more formally } x = e[x] \\text{ with probability 1} \\end{align} concave function we are going to apply the same arguments with a concave function. note that a concave function equals the negative of a convex function, thus: let \\(f\\) be a concave function (e.g. \\(f''(x) < 0\\)) and let \\(x\\) be a random variable, then \\begin{align} f(e[x]) \\geq e[f(x)] \\end{align} where \\(e\\) is the expected value. further, if \\(f''(x) < 0\\) (we say f is strictly concave), then: \\begin{align} e[f(x)] = f(e[x]) \\leftrightarrow \\text{ x is a constant, more formally } x = e[x] \\text{ with probability 1} \\end{align} some intuition given any convex function (the inverse also applies to concave functions), if we draw a chord between any two points, its middle point (that is the expected value of the function or \\(e[f(x)]\\)) is always above that the value of the expected value under the function (that is \\(f(e[x])\\)). graphically: motivation given a model for \\(p(x, z , \\theta)\\) where \\(\\theta\\) are the parameters of the model. we only observe \\(x = \\{x^{(1)}, \\cdots, x^{(m)}\\}\\). the goal is to obtain by the maximum likelihood estimation the value of \\(\\theta\\) that maximizes the log likelihood, defined as: \\begin{align} \\theta = \\underset{\\theta}{\\arg \\max{l(\\theta)} } = \\sum_{i=1}^m \\log (p(x^{(i)}; \\theta)) \\end{align} if we marginalize \\(z^{(i)}\\): \\begin{align} \\theta = \\underset{\\theta}{\\arg \\max{l(\\theta)} } = \\sum_{i=1}^m \\log \\sum_{z^{(i)}} (p(x^{(i)}, z^{(i)}; \\theta)) \\end{align} e-step in the e-step we construct a lower bound from a given theta: so, let's say \\(l(\\theta)\\) is the log likelihood. on the first iteration, the graph would be as follows: and on the second iteration: we iterate until there are no significant changes in the lower bound, that is the algorithm converges to a local optimum (it should be noted the optimum is local not absolute, and it depends on the initialization of the distributions' parameters). m-step now, in the m-step we maximize the log likelihood as follows: \\begin{align} \\underset{\\theta}{\\max{ }} \\sum_{i=1}^m \\log p(x^{(i)}; \\theta) \\end{align} by marginalizing \\(z^{(i)}\\): \\begin{align} \\underset{\\theta}{\\max{ }} \\sum_{i=1}^m \\log \\sum_{z^{(i)}} p(x^{(i)}, z^{(i)}; \\theta) \\end{align} we now introduce a probability distribution over \\(z^{(i)}\\) (thus \\(\\sum_{z^{(i)}}q(z^{(i)}) = 1\\)), and we multiply by \\(\\frac{q(z^{(i)})}{q(z^{(i)})}\\): \\begin{align} \\underset{\\theta}{\\max{ }} \\sum_{i=1}^m \\log \\sum_{z^{(i)}} q(z^{(i)}) \\frac{p(x^{(i)}, z^{(i)}; \\theta)}{q(z^{(i)})} \\end{align} now, by the definition of expected value (given a sequence of real values \\(a_1, \\cdots, a_n\\) with probabilities \\(p_1, \\cdots, p_n\\), the expected value is defined as: \\(e = \\sum_{i=1}^n p_i a_i\\)), if \\(p_i = q(z^{(i)})\\) and \\(a_i = \\frac{p(x^{(i)}, z^{(i)}; \\theta)}{q(z^{(i)})}\\) \\begin{align} \\underset{\\theta}{\\max{ }} \\sum_{i=1}^m \\log e_{z^{(i)}\\sim q} \\left[\\frac{p(x^{(i)}, z^{(i)}; \\theta)}{q(z^{(i)})}\\right] \\end{align} if we apply the concave version of jensen's inequality we obtain a lower bound of the form: \\begin{align} \\sum_{i=1}^m \\log e_{z^{(i)}\\sim q} \\left[\\frac{p(x^{(i)}, z^{(i)}; \\theta)}{q(z^{(i)})}\\right] \\geq \\sum_{i=1}^m e_{z^{(i)} \\sim q} \\left[\\log \\frac{p(x^{(i)}, z^{(i)}; \\theta)}{q(z^{(i)})} \\right] \\end{align} if \\(\\log (x) = f(x)\\), then this equation can be mapped to the inequality: \\begin{align} f(e[x]) \\geq e[f(x)] \\end{align} note that \\(log\\) is a concave function. if we \"unpack\" the expected value: \\begin{align} \\sum_{i=1}^m e_{z^{(i)} \\sim q} \\left[\\log \\frac{p(x^{(i)}, z^{(i)}; \\theta)}{q(z^{(i)})} \\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^m \\sum_{z^{(i)}} \\log q(z^{(i)}) \\left[\\frac{p(x^{(i)}, z^{(i)}; \\theta)}{q(z^{(i)})}\\right] \\end{align} make log likelihood and lower bound equal on theta for each \\(\\theta\\) on the e-step you wan the value of \\(\\theta\\) under the lower bound function to be equal to \\(l(\\theta)\\), which is what guarantees that when you optimize the lower bound you optimize \\(l(\\theta)\\). so, for a given iteration the current value of \\(\\theta\\), denoted by \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\), we want: \\begin{align} \\sum_{i=1}^m \\log e_{z^{(i)}\\sim q} \\left[\\frac{p(x^{(i)}, z^{(i)}; \\hat{\\theta})}{q(z^{(i)})}\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^m e_{z^{(i)} \\sim q} \\left[\\log \\frac{p(x^{(i)}, z^{(i)}; \\hat{\\theta})}{q(z^{(i)})} \\right] \\end{align} remember, by the extension on jensen's inequality we know that \\(e[f(x)] = f(e[x])\\) if and only if \\(x\\) is a constant. in this case \\begin{align} x = \\frac{p(x^{(i)}, z^{(i)}; \\hat{\\theta})}{q(z^{(i)})} = constant \\end{align} for this to hold, we need \\(q(z^{(i)})\\) to be directly proportional to \\(p(x^{(i)}, z^{(i)}; \\hat{\\theta})\\) (so when one is bigger the other is bigger and vice versa, so the ratio between the two remains constant). so: \\begin{align} q(z^{(i)}) \\propto p(x^{(i)}, z^{(i)}; \\hat{\\theta}) \\end{align} because \\(\\sum_{z^{(i)}}q(z^{(i)}) = 1\\), a way to ensure this is to set each \\(q^{(i)} = p(x^{(i)}, z^{(i)}; \\hat{\\theta})\\) and then normalize it to make sure the sum of \\(q\\) over \\(z^{(i)}\\) equals one. hence: \\begin{align} q(z^{(i)}) = \\frac{p(x^{(i)}, z^{(i)}; \\hat{\\theta})}{\\sum_{z^{(i)}} p(x^{(i)}, z^{(i)}; \\hat{\\theta})} \\end{align} it turns out you can further derive this equation to be: \\begin{align} q(z^{(i)}) = p(z^{(i)}|x^{(i)}; \\hat{\\theta}) \\end{align} putting everything together so, after everything we have seen, we can summarize the em generalized algorithm as follows: if \\(\\theta\\) is the value of the parameters in the current iteration: e-step: set \\begin{align} q_i(z^{(i)}) = p(z^{(i)}|x^{(i)}; \\theta) \\end{align} m-step: set \\begin{align} \\theta := \\underset{\\theta}{\\arg \\max} \\sum_{i=1}^m \\sum_{z^{(i)}} q_i(z^{(i)}) \\log \\left[\\frac{p(x^{(i)}, z^{(i)};\\theta)}{q_i(z^{(i)})}\\right] \\end{align} derive em for gmm from the generalized algorithm given a model described by: \\(p(x^{(i)}, z^{(i)}) = p(x^{(i)}|z^{(i)}) p(z^{(i)})\\) where \\(z^{(i)} \\sim multinomial(\\phi)\\) (which means \\(p(z^{(i)} = j) = \\phi_j\\)) and \\(x^{(i)} | z^{(i)} \\sim \\mathcal{n}(\\mu_j, \\sigma_j)\\) e-step on the e-step we compute: \\(q_i(z^{(i)}) p(z^{(i)} = j | x^{(i)}; \\phi, \\mu, \\sigma)\\) if we look at e-step from gmm's we can see that the expression above equals \\(w^{(i)}_j\\). m-step now on the m-step what we do is maximize the lower bound we have constructed in the e-step. for that we need to compute the value of the parameters \\(\\phi, \\mu, \\sigma\\) that maximize this function, that is: \\begin{align} \\underset{\\phi, \\mu, \\sigma}{\\max} \\sum_{i=1}^m \\sum_{z^{(i)}} q_i(z^{(i)}) \\log \\left( \\frac{p(x^{(i)}, z^{(i)}; \\phi, \\mu, \\sigma)}{q_i(z^{(i)})} \\right) = \\end{align} as we know \\(q_i(z^{(i)}) = w^{(i)}_j\\) and \\(p(x^{(i)}, z^{(i)}) = p(x^{(i)}|z^{(i)}) p(z^{(i)})\\), thus: \\begin{align} = \\sum_{i=1}^m \\sum_{j}^k w^{(i)}_j \\log \\left( \\frac{p(x^{(i)}|z^{(i)} = j, \\mu_j, \\sigma_j) p(z^{(i)} = j)}{w^{(i)}_j} \\right) \\end{align} we also know that \\(p(z^{(i)} = j) = \\phi_j\\) and \\(x^{(i)} | z^{(i)} \\sim \\mathcal{n}(\\mu_j, \\sigma_j)\\), therefore: \\begin{align} = \\sum_{i=1}^m \\sum_{j}^k w^{(i)}_j \\log \\left( \\frac{\\mathcal{n}(x^{(i)}; \\mu_j, \\sigma_j) \\phi_j}{w^{(i)}_j} \\right) \\end{align} where: \\begin{align} \\mathcal{n}(x^{(i)}; \\mu_j, \\sigma_j) = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^{1/2}|\\sigma_j|^{1/2}} \\exp \\left( -\\frac{1}{2}(x^{(i)} - \\mu_j)^t \\sigma_j^{-1}(x^{(i)} - \\mu_j)\\right) \\end{align} from now on we denote \\(\\sum_{i=1}^m \\sum_{j}^k w^{(i)}_j \\log \\left( \\frac{\\mathcal{n}(x^{(i)}; \\mu_j, \\sigma_j) \\phi_j}{w^{(i)}_j} \\right)\\) as \\(\\mathcal{l}(\\phi, \\mu, \\sigma)\\): to maximize this formula over \\(\\phi, \\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) you have to compute the derivatie of the function with respect to each parameter, such that: \\(\\delta_{\\mu_j} (\\mathcal{l}(\\phi, \\mu, \\sigma)) = 0\\), then: \\(\\mu_j = \\sum_{i}^m \\frac{w^{(i)}_j x^{(i)}_j}{w^{(i)}_j}\\) (same as in m-step in gmm's) \\(\\delta_{\\sigma_j} (\\mathcal{l}(\\phi, \\mu,

se define como sigue: \\begin{align} error(h_\\theta(x), y) = \\begin{cases} 1, & \\text{ si } h_\\theta(x) \\geq 0.5 \\rightarrow \\log(h_\\theta(x)) = 1 \\text{ e } y = 0 \\\\ 1, & \\text{ si }

modelos, tal que cada modelo es equivalente al anterior pero con una caracterÃ­stica mÃ¡s en sus datos: modelo 1: \\(h_\\theta(x) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 \\cdot x_1\\) modelo 2: \\(h_\\theta(x) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 \\cdot x_1 + \\theta_2 \\cdot x_2\\) modelo n: \\(h_\\theta(x) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 \\cdot x_1 + \\theta_2 \\cdot x_2 + \\cdots + \\theta_n \\cdot x_n\\) para evaluar los modelos lo que hacemos es escoger el que menor coste obtenga sobre el conjunto de test, tras ser entrenado sobre el conjunto de entrenamiento. \\begin{align} \\begin{bmatrix} \\theta^{(1)} \\\\ \\theta^{(2)} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\theta^{(n)} \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\rightarrow \\begin{bmatrix} j_{test}(\\theta^{(1)}) \\\\ j_{test}(\\theta^{(2)}) \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ j_{test}(\\theta^{(n)}) \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\end{align} sin embargo, se puede dar el problema de que el mejor simplemente produzca overfitting sobre el conjunto de test (lo cual es probable cuando el vector de pesos tiene dimensiones grandes). para solventar este problema: cross validation separaremos el conjunto de datos en tres conjuntos: conjunto de entrenamiento: \\(60\\%\\) conjunto de validaciÃ³n cruzada (cross validation): \\(20\\%\\) conunto de test: \\(20\\%\\) por lo tanto ahora la funciÃ³n de coste para cada conjunto tiene la forma: funciÃ³n de coste para el conjunto de entrenamiento: \\begin{align} j_{train}(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2m_{train}} \\sum_{i=1}^{m_{train}} error(h_\\theta(x^{(i)}), y^{(i)}) \\end{align} funciÃ³n de coste para el conjunto de test: \\begin{align} j_{test}(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2m_{test}} \\sum_{i=1}^{m_{test}} error(h_\\theta(x^{(i)}), y^{(i)}) \\end{align} funciÃ³n de coste para el conjunto de validaciÃ³n cruzada: \\begin{align} j_{cv}(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2m_{cv}} \\sum_{i=1}^{m_{cv}} error(h_\\theta(x^{(i)}), y^{(i)}) \\end{align} proceso de selecciÃ³n entonces ahora para seleccionar un modelo lo que hacemos que para cada modelo \\(q\\): minimizamos \\(j_{train}(\\theta^{(q)})\\) para obtener los pesos \\(\\theta^{(q)}\\) Ã³ptimos. calculamos el coste sobre el conjunto de validaciÃ³n cruzada \\(j_{cv}(\\theta^{(q)})\\) una vez hecho esto para todos, escogemos el modelo que ofrezca el mejor coste sobre el conjunto de validaciÃ³n cruzada y calculamos \\(j_{test}(\\theta^{(q)})\\) para evaluar la capacidad de generalizaciÃ³n del modelo. diagnÃ³stico: sesgo vs varianza underfitting: cuando se produce underfitting el coste de entrenamiento y el coste de validaciÃ³n tienen valores similares y ambos tiene valores bastante altos overfitting: cuando se produce overfitting el coste de entrenamiento es mucho menor que el coste de validaciÃ³n cruzada. regresiÃ³n lineal con regularizaciÃ³n tambiÃ©n es importante observar cÃ³mo afecta el parÃ¡metro de regularizaciÃ³n a nuestros modelos. por ejemplo, en la regresiÃ³n linear, la funciÃ³n de coste tiene la forma: \\begin{align} j(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2m}\\sum_{j=1}^m (h_\\theta(x_j) - y_j)^2 + \\frac{1}{2m} \\lambda \\sum_{i=1}^n \\theta_i^2 \\end{align} por lo tanto, el aumentar o reducir \\(\\lambda\\) es directamente proporcional al coste. si el parÃ¡metro de regularizaciÃ³n \\(\\lambda\\) es muy grande entonces los pesos van a tender a ser muy pequeÃ±os (ya que el coste aumenta al aumentar el valor de \\(\\lambda\\)) si el parÃ¡metro de regularizaciÃ³n \\(\\lambda\\) es muy pequeÃ±o entonces los pesos van a poder ser grandes (ya que el coste se reduce al reducir el valor de \\(\\lambda\\)) escoger el parÃ¡metro de regularizaciÃ³n para escoger el parÃ¡metro de regularizaciÃ³n seguimos el mismo proceso que para escoger el mejor modelo, para cada modelo \\(q\\): minimizamos \\(j_{train}(\\theta^{(q)})\\) para obtener los pesos \\(\\theta^{(q)}\\) Ã³ptimos. calculamos el coste sobre el conjunto de validaciÃ³n cruzada \\(j_{cv}(\\theta^{(q)})\\) una vez hecho esto para todos, escogemos el modelo que ofrezca el mejor coste sobre el conjunto de validaciÃ³n cruzada y calculamos \\(j_{test}(\\theta^{(q)})\\) para evaluar la capacidad de generalizaciÃ³n del modelo. curva de aprendizaje a continuaciÃ³n vamos a estudiar cÃ³mo afecta el tamaÃ±o del conjunto de datos \\(m\\), el sesgo y la varianza a nuestro modelo: cuanto mayor es el tamaÃ±o, mÃ¡s difÃ­cil es encontrar una hipÃ³tesis que se adapte (\\(j_{train}(\\theta)\\) es mayor), pero el modelo generaliza mejor (\\(j_{cv}(\\theta)\\) es menor) cuando el sesgo (bias) es grande, entonces se produce underfitting y las predicciones de nuestro modelo son malas: el error del modelo es elevado, tanto sobre el conjunto de entrenamiento como sobre el conjunto de validaciÃ³n cruzada tener mÃ¡s ejemplos ayuda al modelo cuando la varianza (variance) es grande, entonces se produce overfitting, tal que el error en el conjunto de validaciÃ³n cruzada es muy alto: el modelo se adapta al conjunto de datos, por lo que el error de entrenamiento es menor tener mÃ¡s muestras ayuda al modelo debugging un algoritmo de aprendizaje para arreglar el overfitting que se produce cuando la varianza es elevada: obtener mÃ¡s datos de entrenamiento utilizar menos caracterÃ­sticas (reducir el grado del vector de pesos), pero tras un proceso de selecciÃ³n de aquellas mÃ¡s relevantes intentar aumentar el parÃ¡metro de regularizaciÃ³n para arregar el underfitting que se produce cuando el sesgo es elevado: aÃ±adir mÃ¡s caracterÃ­sticas aÃ±adir caracterÃ­sticas polinÃ³micas intentar reducir el parÃ¡metro de regularizaciÃ³n en las redes neuronales: las redes pequeÃ±as tienden a producir underfitting pero son menos costosas computacionalmente las redes grandes tienen mÃ¡s caracterÃ­sticas, por lo tanto hay una mayor probabilidad de overfitting gestionar datos sesgados: hay que ser consciente que a veces, por ejemplo en problemas de clasificaciÃ³n, hay categorÃ­as que con mÃ¡s comunes que el resto medidas de evaluaciÃ³n la precisiÃ³n y el recall son medidas de evaluaciÃ³n que se complementan: Â  Â  resultado resultado Â  Â  1 0 predicciÃ³n 1 verdadero positivo (tp) falso positivo (fp) predicciÃ³n 0 falso negativo (fn) verdadero negativo (tn) precisiÃ³n = \\(\\frac{tp}{\\text{ # positivos predichos }} = \\frac{tp}{tp + fp}\\) recall = \\(\\frac{tp}{\\text{ # positivos reales }} = \\frac{tp}{tp + fn}\\) balance entre precisiÃ³n y recall cuÃ¡nto mayor es la precisiÃ³n menor es el recall y viceversa. entonces si queremos un modelo mÃ¡s preciso: \\begin{align} \\begin{cases} \\text{predecir } 1, \\text{ si } h_\\theta(x) \\geq 0.7 \\\\ \\text{predecir } 0, \\text{ si } h_\\theta(x) < 0.7 \\\\ \\end{cases} \\end{align} entonces, la precisiÃ³n es mayor ya que el nÃºmero de \\(fp\\) es menor, pero el recall es menor, ya que el nÃºmero de \\(fn\\) es mayor. lo mismo pasa si queremos evitar falsos negativos, entonces hacemos: \\begin{align} \\begin{cases} \\text{predecir } 1, \\text{ si } h_\\theta(x) \\geq 0.5 \\\\ \\text{predecir } 0, \\text{ si } h_\\theta(x) < 0.5 \\\\ \\end{cases} \\end{align} tal que se reduce el nÃºmero de \\(fn\\), y se aumenta el recall, pero el nÃºmero de \\(fp\\) es mayor, por lo que se reduce la precisiÃ³n. entonces, para encontrar un punto de balance entre las dos medidas tenemos que seleccionar un valor lÃ­mite, tal que hacemos la predicciÃ³n en base a \\(h_\\theta(x) \\geq \\text{ limite }\\). para calibrar ese lÃ­mite podemos utilizar dos mÃ©tricas de evaluaciÃ³n: la media de ambas mÃ©tricas: \\(\\frac{p + r}{2}\\), funciona mal cuando \\(p >> r\\) o \\(r >> p\\), ya que el valor va a ser alto, pero no se ha encontrado un equilibrio. la puntuaciÃ³n \\(f_1 = 2 \\cdot \\frac{p\\cdot r}{(p + r)}\\), tal que cuanto mayor sea esta puntuaciÃ³n mejor ahora \\begin{align} \\begin{cases} f_1 \\approx 0, && p >> r \\\\ f_1 \\approx 0, && r >> p \\\\ \\end{cases} \\end{align} para escoger el lÃ­mite lo que se hace es calcular la puntuaciÃ³n \\(f_1\\) sobre el conjunto de validaciÃ³n cruzada, y se escoge aquel lÃ­mite que ofrezca la mayor puntuaciÃ³n. $(\"pre\").each(function (index, item) { $(item).html(\"<code>\" + $(item).html() + \"</code>\"); }); hljs.highlightall(); "

    "title": "Information criteria and cross-validation",
    "body": " index search search back information criteria and cross-validation for historical reasons, measures of predictive accuracy are referred to as information criteria. these criteria are usually based on something called deviance that it's calculated by taking the negative two times the logarithm of the likelihood of the data given a point estimate of the model, \\(-2 \\log p(y|\\hat{\\theta}))\\). when we make predictions about new data that the model hasn't seen before, these predictions are usually less accurate than what we'd expect based on how well the model fits the data it was trained on. even if the family of models being fit happens to include the true data-generating process, and even if the parameters in the model happen to be sampled exactly from the specified prior distribution. we are interested in prediction accuracy for two reasons: to measure the performance of a model. to compare models. when comparing models with the same number of parameters, we can directly compare their best-fit log predictive densities. but when comparing models of different sizes or complexities we need to adjust for the fact that larger models can sometimes fit data better just by chance. estimating out-of-sample predictive accuracy using available data several methods are available to estimate the expected predictive accuracy without waiting for out-of-sample data. within-sample predictive accuracy: a naive estimate of the expected log predictive density for new data is the log predictive density for existing data using the computed lppd. this summary is in general an overestimate of elppd because it is evaluated on the data from which the model was fit. adjusted within-sample predictive accuracy: given that lppd is a biased estimate of elppd, the next logical step is to correct that bias. formulas such as aic, dic, and waic (all discussed below) give approximately unbiased estimates of elppd. cross-validation: one can attempt to capture out-of-sample prediction error by fitting the model to training data and then evaluating this predictive accuracy on a holdout set. cross-validation can be computationally expensive. akaike information criterion (aic) in much of the statistical literature on predictive accuracy, inference for \\(\\theta\\) is summarized not by a posterior distribution \\(p_{\\text{post}}\\) but by a point estimate \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\), typically the maximum likelihood estimate. out-of-sample predictive accuracy is then defined not by the expected log posterior predictive density (elppd) but by \\(\\text{elpd}_{\\hat{\\theta}} = \\mathbb{e}_f[\\log p(\\tilde{y}|\\tilde{\\theta}(y))]\\). let \\(k\\) be the number of parameters estimated in the model. aic is defined as follows: \\begin{align} \\hat{\\text{elpd}}_{\\text{aic}} = -2 \\log p(y|\\hat{\\theta}_{\\text{mle}}) + 2k \\end{align} subtracting \\(k\\) from the log predictive density given the maximum likelihood estimate \\(\\theta_{\\text{mle}}\\) is a correction to account for how much the fitting of \\(k\\) parameters will increase predictive accuracy, purely by chance. when we move beyond linear models with simple priors, just adding the number of fitted parameters \\(k\\) to adjust the deviance isn't accurate. informative priors and hierarchical structures typically decrease overfitting compared to simple estimation methods like least squares or maximum likelihood. in models with informative priors or hierarchical setups, the actual number of parameters depends heavily on the variance of the group-level parameter. deviance information criterion (dic) and effective number of parameters dic is a somewhat bayesian version of aic making two changes, replacing the maximum likelihood estimate with the posterior mean \\(\\hat{\\theta}_{\\text{bayes}} = \\mathbb{e}[\\theta|y]\\) and replacing \\(k\\) with a data-based bias correction. the new measure of predictive accuracy is: \\begin{align} \\hat{\\text{elpd}}_{dic} = \\log p(y|\\hat{\\theta}_{\\text{bayes}}) - p_{\\text{dic}} \\end{align} where \\(p_{\\text{dic}}\\) is the effective number of parameters, defined as: \\begin{align} p_{\\text{dic}} = 2 \\left(\\log p(y|\\hat{\\theta}_{\\text{bayes}}) - \\mathbb{e}_{post}[\\log p(y|\\theta)]\\right) \\end{align} where \\(\\mathbb{e}_{post}[\\log p(y|\\theta)]\\) is an average of \\(\\theta\\) over its posterior distribution. this is computed using simulation \\(\\theta^s, s= 1, \\cdots, s\\) as: \\begin{align} \\text{computed } p_{\\text{dic}} = 2 \\left(\\log p(y|\\hat{\\theta}_{\\text{bayes}}) - \\frac{1}{s} \\sum_{s=1}^s \\log p(y|\\theta^s)\\right) \\end{align} when the average value of \\(\\theta\\) in the posterior distribution matches the highest point (mode), it leads to the maximum log predictive density. however, if the average value is significantly different from the mode, it can result in a negative value for \\(p_{\\text{dic}}\\). an alternative version of dic uses a slightly different effective number of parameters: \\begin{align} p_{\\text{dic}_{\\text{alt}}} = 2 \\mathbb{v}_{\\text{post}}[\\log p(y|\\theta)] \\end{align} of these two measures, \\(p_{\\text{dic}}\\) is more numerically stable but \\(p_{\\text{dic}_{\\text{alt}}}\\) has the advantage of always being positive. the actual quantity called dic is defined in terms of the deviance rather than the log predictive density; thus: \\begin{align} \\text{dic} = -2 \\log p(y|\\hat{\\theta}_{\\text{bayes}}) + 2p_{dic} \\end{align} watanabe-akaike or widely applicable information criterion (waic) waic is a more fully bayesian approach for estimating the out-of-sample expectation. starting with the computed lppd and then adding a correction for effective number of parameters to adjust for overfitting. two adjustments have been proposed: \\begin{align} p_{\\text{waic}1} = 2 \\sum_{n=1}^n \\left(\\log(\\mathbb{e}_{\\text{post}}[p(y_i|\\theta)]) - \\mathbb{e}_{\\text{post}}[\\log p(y_i|\\theta)] \\right) \\end{align} computed by replacing the expectations by averages over the \\(s\\) posterior draws \\(\\theta^s\\): \\begin{align} \\text{computed } p_{\\text{waic}1} = 2 \\sum_{n=1}^n \\left(\\log\\left(\\frac{1}{s}\\sum_{s=1}^s p(y_i|\\theta^s)\\right) - \\frac{1}{s}\\sum_{s=1}^s \\log p(y_i|\\theta^s) \\right) \\end{align} the other measure uses the variance of individual terms: \\begin{align} p_{\\text{waic}2} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathbb{v}_{\\text{post}}[\\log p(y_i|\\theta)] \\end{align} to compute it we compute the posterior sample variance (\\(\\mathbb{v}_{s=1}^s\\)) of the log predictive density for each data point \\(y_i\\) and we sum over all the data points: \\begin{align} \\text{computed } p_{\\text{waic}2} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathbb{v}_{s=1}^s[\\log p(y_i|\\theta^s)] \\end{align} we can then use either \\(p_{\\text{waic}1}\\) or \\(p_{\\text{waic}2}\\) as a bias correction: \\begin{align} \\hat{\\text{elppd}}_{\\text{waic}} = \\text{lppd} - p_{\\text{waic}} \\end{align} as with \\(\\text{aic}\\) and \\(\\text{dic}\\), we define \\(\\text{waic}\\) so as to be on the deviance scale: \\begin{align} \\text{waic} = -2\\text{lppd} + 2p_{\\text{waic}2} \\end{align} for a normal linear model with a large sample size, known variance, and a uniform prior distribution on the coefficients, \\(p_{\\text{waic}1}\\) and \\(p_{\\text{waic}2}\\) are roughly equal to the number of parameters in the model. in general, this adjustment approximates the number of \"unconstrained\" parameters in the model. a parameter is counted as \\(1\\) if it's estimated without constraints or prior information, \\(0\\) if it's fully constrained, or if all the information comes from the prior distribution, or a value in between if both the data and prior distributions provide information. waic stands out because it averages over the whole posterior distribution rather than relying on a single point estimate, which is what aic and dic do. this makes waic more relevant when it comes to predicting new data in a bayesian framework. however, using waic requires dividing the data into \\(n\\) parts, which can be challenging in certain data setups like time series or spatial data. aic and dic don't require this explicit partition, but they assume that residuals are independent given a point estimate \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\), which may not fully capture posterior uncertainty. effective number of parameters as a random variable the number of parameters estimated in a model, as measured by \\(p_{\\text{dic}}\\) and \\(p_{\\text{waic}}\\), can vary depending on the observed data. let's take a simple example: imagine a model where the data \\(y_1, \\cdots, y_n\\) follow a normal distribution with a mean parameter \\(\\theta\\) and a known standard deviation of \\(1\\). the parameter \\(\\theta\\) is drawn from a uniform distribution between \\(0\\) and infinity, meaning it's positive but otherwise not informative. now, consider two scenarios: imagine you have a bunch of data points, but they are all very close to zero. in this case, the model has to consider that the parameter \\(\\theta\\) could be anywhere from very small positive values up to infinity. however, since the data are all close to zero, they don't provide much information about where \\(\\theta\\) might lie. the only constraint is that \\(\\theta\\) has to be positive. because the data don't give a strong indication of where \\(\\theta\\) might be, we say the effective number of parameters is roughly half. this is because half of the information about \\(\\theta\\) comes from the data, and the other half comes from the prior constraint that \\(\\theta\\) must be positive. now, imagine your data points are all large and positive. in this case, the constraint that \\(\\theta\\) must be positive doesn't really affect things much because the data already tell us that \\(\\theta\\) needs to be positive to explain those large positive values. since the data provide most of the information about where \\(\\theta\\) might lie, we say the effective number of parameters is approximately \\(1\\). this means that the data have a stronger influence on determining \\(\\theta\\) in this scenario. this example shows that even with the same model and true parameters, the effective number of parameters can change depending on the observed data. bayesian information criterion (bic) bic is a way to decide between different models by considering both how well the model fits the data and how complex the model is. the formula for bic is: \\begin{align} -2 \\log (p(y|\\hat{\\theta})) + k \\log(n) \\end{align} where \\(p(y|\\hat{\\theta})\\) is the likelihood of the data given the estimated parameters, \\(k\\) is the number of parameters in the model and \\(n\\) is the sample size. bic aims to approximate the marginal probability density of the data under the model, which can be used for comparing models and estimating relative posterior probabilities. bic tends to favor simpler models for large datasets because it penalizes complexity more, so a complicated model may perform well in predicting data but still have a high bic due to the penalty for complexity. unlike aic, which doesn't take the sample size into account, bic penalizes complex models more as the sample size increases. unlike aic, dic, and waic, bic doesn't focus on predicting future data but rather on estimating the probability of the observed data under the model. leave-one-out cross-validation in bayesian cross-validation, we split the data into two parts: a training set (\\(y_{\\text{ytrain}}\\)) and a holdout set (\\(y_{\\text{holdout}}\\)). we repeat this process multiple times, such that for each split: we train the model using the training set (\\(\\text{ytrain}\\)). this gives us a distribution of possible parameter values called \\(p_{\\text{train}}(\\theta) = p(\\theta|y_{\\text{train}})\\). then, we use this trained model to make predictions on the holdout set (\\(y_\\text{holdout}\\)). we evaluate the performance of our predictions using the log predictive density: \\begin{align} \\log p_{\\text{train}}(y_{\\text{holdout}}) = \\log \\mathbb{e}_{\\text{post}}[p_{\\text{train}}(y_{\\text{holdout}})] = \\log \\int p_{\\text{pred}}(y_{\\text{holdout}}|\\theta)p_{\\text{train}}(\\theta)d\\theta \\end{align} assuming the posterior distribution \\(p(\\theta|y_{\\text{train}})\\) is summarized by \\(s\\) simulation draws \\(\\theta^s\\), we calculate the log predictive density as: \\begin{align} \\log \\left(\\frac{1}{s} \\sum_{s=1}^s p(y_{\\text{holdout}}|\\theta^s)\\right) \\end{align} in loocv, we split the data into \\(n\\) partitions, where each partition represents a single data point. performing the analysis for each of the \\(n\\) data points yields n different inferences \\(p_{\\text{post}(-i)}\\), each summarized by \\(s\\) posterior simulations, \\(\\theta^{is}\\). the bayesian loo-cv estimate of out-of-sample predictive fit is: \\begin{align} \\text{lppd}_{\\text{loo-cv}} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\log (p_{\\text{post}(-i)}(y_i)) \\end{align} computed as: \\begin{align} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\log \\left(\\frac{1}{s} \\sum_{s=1}^s p(y_i|\\theta^{is})\\right) \\end{align} where \\(\\theta^s\\) represents the \\(s\\) simulations under the posterior distribution \\(p(\\theta|y_{-1})\\). each prediction is conditioned on \\(n â 1\\) data points, which causes underestimation of the predictive fit. for large \\(n\\) the difference is negligible, but for small \\(n\\) (or when using \\(k\\)-fold cross-validation) we can use a first order bias correction b by estimating how much better predictions would be obtained if conditioning on \\(n\\) data points: \\begin{align} b = \\text{lppd} - \\overline{\\text{lppd}}_{-i} \\end{align} where: \\begin{align} \\overline{\\text{lppd}}_{-i} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^n \\log p_{\\text{post}(-i)}(y_j) \\end{align} computed as: \\begin{align} \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^n \\log \\left(\\frac{1}{s} \\sum_{s=1}^s p(y_j|\\theta^{is})\\right) \\end{align} the bias-corrected bayesian loo-cv is then: \\begin{align} \\text{lppd}_{\\text{cloo-cv}} = \\text{lppd}_{\\text{loo-cv}} + b \\end{align} the bias correction \\(b\\) is rarely used as it is usually small, but we include it for completeness. we compute an estimate of the effective number of parameters as: \\begin{align} p_{\\text{loo-cv}} = \\text{lppd} - \\text{lppd}_{\\text{loo-cv}} \\end{align} or, using bias-corrected loo-cv: \\begin{align} p_{\\text{cloo-cv}} = \\text{lppd} - \\text{lppd}_{\\text{cloo-cv}} \\end{align} \\begin{align} = \\overline{\\text{lppd}}_{-i} - \\text{lppd}_{\\text{loo-cv}} \\end{align} cv, like waic, requires the data to be split into distinct and ideally independent pieces. this can be challenging for structured models where the data isn't easily divided. additionally, cv can be computationally expensive, especially if the model needs to be re-fit for each fold. however, there are some shortcuts available, such as leave-one-out cross-validation (loo-cv), which can efficiently approximate predictions using the full posterior distribution. under certain conditions, different information criteria (like aic, dic, and waic) have been shown to be equivalent to loo-cv as the size of the dataset becomes very large. aic is equivalent to loo-cv when using maximum likelihood estimates. dic is a variation of regularized information criteria that approximates loo-cv using plug-in predictive densities. waic has been shown to be equivalent to bayesian loo-cv. loo-cv predicts the outcome for one data point using all other data points except that one. waic predicts the outcome for a data point using all observed data points. this difference becomes noticeable when dealing with small datasets or complex models, like hierarchical models. in regression or hierarchical models, loo-cv focuses on predicting specific data points, while waic predicts outcomes based on all observed data. this distinction can be important in models where predictions at one point are only weakly influenced by other data points. summary all the different measures discussed above are based on adjusting the log predictive density of the observed data by subtracting an approximate bias correction. the measures differ both in their baseline measures of fit and in their adjustments. aic starts with the log predictive density of the data conditional on the maximum likelihood estimate \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\), dic conditions on the posterior mean \\(\\mathbb{e}[\\theta|y]\\), and waic starts with the log predictive density, averaging over \\(p_{\\text{post}}(\\theta) = p(\\theta|y)\\). of these three approaches, only waic is fully bayesian and so it is our preference when using a bias correction formula. cross-validation can be applied to any measure of fit; we use the log pointwise posterior predictive density as with waic. $(\"pre\").each(function (index, item) { $(item).html(\"<code>\" +

    "title": "Model Comparison Based on Predictive Performance",
    "body": " index search search back model comparison based on predictive performance there are two common scenarios where we compare models. first, when we expand a model, we naturally want to compare the simpler version to the more complex one. we want to see if adding complexity improves the model's performance. conversely, if we simplify a model, we want to understand what information we might be losing. in essence, we're trying to figure out how much complexity is necessary to accurately represent the data. when comparing nested models, the bigger model usually fits the data better but can be more complex and harder to understand. so, we need to ask two main questions: does the better fit of the larger model justify its added complexity? and are the extra parameters in the larger model reasonable based on our prior knowledge? in the second scenario, we're comparing models that aren't nested. for example, we might compare two regression models that use different predictors to explain the same data. in these cases, we're not necessarily trying to pick one model over the other. instead, we might want to build a larger model that includes both sets of predictors, along with any interactions between them. this way, we get a more comprehensive picture. however, it's still useful to compare the performance of each model on its own to see how well they do individually. example on the eight schools example we defined three separate models: no pooling: separate estimates for each of the eight schools, reflecting that the experiments were performed independently. this model has eight parameters: an estimate for each school. complete pooling: a combined estimate averaging the data from all schools into a single number, reflecting that the eight schools come from the same population. this model has only one, shared, parameter. hierarchical model: a bayesian meta-analysis, partially pooling the eight estimates toward a common mean. this model has eight parameters but they are constrained through their hierarchical distribution and are not estimated independently; thus the effective number of parameters should be some number less than 8. in the following table we show the performance metrics for each of the models using predivtive log densities and information criteria. aic the log predictive density is higherâthat is, a better fitâfor the no pooling model. this makes sense: with no pooling, the maximum likelihood estimate is right at the data, whereas with complete pooling there is only one number to fit all \\(8\\) schools. however, the ranking of the models changes after adjusting for the fitted parameters (\\(8\\) for no pooling, \\(1\\) for complete pooling), and the expected log predictive density is estimated to be the best (that is, aic is lowest) for complete pooling. the last column of the table is blank for aic, as this procedure is defined based on maximum likelihood estimation which is meaningless for the hierarchical model. dic for both the no-pooling and complete-pooling models with their flat priors, dic provides results similar to aic. however, for the hierarchical model, dic falls in between the two extremes: it fits the data better than complete pooling but not as well as no pooling, and it suggests an effective number of parameters closer to \\(1\\) than to \\(8\\). this indicates that the estimated school effects are mostly pooled back to their common mean. when considering the correction for fitting, complete pooling emerges as the winner, which aligns with the idea that the data support very little variation between groups. waic this bayesian measure, similar to dic, indicates slightly worse fit to observed data for each model. this is because the posterior predictive density has a wider distribution, resulting in lower density values at the mode compared to the predictive density conditional on the point estimate. however, the correction for the effective number of parameters is lower with waic compared to dic. for models with no pooling and hierarchical models, the effective number of parameters (\\(p_{\\text{waic}}\\)) is about half of what's estimated by dic, suggesting that waic behaves as expected when there's only one data point per parameter. conversely, for complete pooling, \\(p_{\\text{waic}}\\) is only slightly less than \\(1\\), which aligns with expectations given the sample size of \\(8\\). overall, \\(p_{\\text{waic}}\\) is much less than pdic for all three models, mainly because the waic already considers much of the uncertainty stemming from parameter estimation. cross validation for this example, it's impossible to cross-validate the no-pooling model because it would mean predicting the performance of one school using data from the other seven, which isn't feasible. this highlights a key difference from information criteria, which assume predictions for the same schools and can work even in the absence of pooling. however, for the complete pooling and hierarchical models, we can directly perform leave-one-out cross-validation. in this setup, cross-validation predicts based only on information from other schools, while waic considers both the local observation and information from other schools. although both methods predict unknown future data, they differ in the amount of information used. as the hierarchical prior becomes less informative (or more vague), the predictive performance estimates diverge further, with the difference approaching infinity when the hierarchical prior becomes uninformative, effectively yielding the no-pooling model. comparing the three models in this dataset, the complete pooling model performs best in predicting new data. surprisingly, setting the hierarchical variance \\(\\tau\\) to zero results in a better fit to the data compared to both no pooling and complete pooling models. however, despite this result, we still prefer the hierarchical model because we don't believe \\(\\tau\\) is truly zero. for instance, the estimated effects in schools a and c show some differences, although they are not statistically significant. the data suggest that there might be no variation in effects between schools, but we are not entirely confident in this conclusion. therefore, while the model with \\(\\tau = 0\\) performs well, we might consider using a more informative prior distribution for \\(\\tau\\) to better capture the uncertainty and avoid implausible scenarios. in general, predictive accuracy measures are useful in parallel with posterior predictive checks to see if there are important patterns in the data that are not captured by each model. evaluating predictive error comparisons when comparing models for their predictive accuracy, we face two main challenges: statistical significance and practical significance. statistical significance arises from the uncertainty in estimating how well a model predicts new data. this uncertainty is due to variation in individual prediction errors, which can affect the averages we calculate from any finite dataset. a practical estimate of related sampling uncertainty can be obtained by analyzing the variation in the expected log predictive densities \\(\\hat{\\text{elppd}}\\) using parametric or nonparametric approaches. in some cases, we can use scoring functions that are familiar to experts in a particular field to understand the significance of differences in predictive accuracy. however, in situations where there are no established measures like auc, it can be challenging to interpret the significance of differences in log predictive probability between two models. one way to gauge the importance of such differences is by comparing them to simpler models. consider a scenario where we have two models for a survey of voters in an election: one model predicts a \\(50\\)/\\(50\\) chance for each voter to support either party, while the other model correctly assigns probabilities of \\(0.4\\) and \\(0.6\\) to the voters. in this case, the improvement in log predictive probability from using the better model can be calculated. for instance, if we have \\(1000\\) voters, the improvement would be \\(20\\), but for only \\(10\\) voters, the improvement would be just \\(2\\). this aligns with our intuition: a clear improvement in prediction is more noticeable in a larger dataset than in a smaller one where noise might overshadow the improvement. bias induced by model selection cross-validation and information criteria are methods that adjust for using the data twiceâonce for building the model and again for evaluating its performance. they aim to provide unbiased estimates of how well a model predicts new data. however, when these methods are used to select a model from multiple options, the estimate of predictive performance for the chosen model can be biased because of the selection process. when there are only a few models to compare, any bias introduced by the selection process is usually small. however, if there are many models to choose from, especially as the number of observations or predictors increases, the selection process can lead to significant overfitting. while it's possible to estimate and correct for this bias using additional cross-validation, it doesn't guarantee that the selected model will have the best predictive performance. therefore, cross-validation and information criteria are better suited for understanding models rather than selecting the best one among many options. challenges the methods we have for measuring how well predictive models fit still have their flaws. aic, dic, and waic don't always work perfectly: aic struggles with strong prior information, dic gives odd results when the average of the posterior distribution isn't reliable, and waic can be tricky to use with structured data like spatial or network data. cross-validation seems like a good alternative, but it can be slow to compute and doesn't always work well with dependent data. bayesian statisticians often don't rely solely on predictive error comparisons in their work because of various limitations. however, there are situations where comparing very different models is necessary, and in those cases, predictive comparisons can be valuable. additionally, measures of effective numbers of parameters are useful for understanding statistical methods. currently, we prefer cross-validation because it's similar to waic in large samples. however, in finite cases with weak priors or strong outliers, pareto-smoothed importance sampling loo-cv is both computationally efficient and robust. $(\"pre\").each(function (index, item) { $(item).html(\"<code>\" + $(item).html() +

    "title": "Model Comparison Using Bayes Factors",
    "body": " index search search back model comparison using bayes factors in this chapter, we've been talking about how to evaluate and compare models by looking at how well they predict outcomes. another way to compare models is using bayesian analysis, where we use something called the bayes factor. so, if we have two models, let's call them \\(h_1\\) and \\(h_2\\), the bayes factor is just the ratio of how probable they are after we've looked at the data: \\begin{align} \\frac{p(h_2|y)}{p(h_1|y)} = \\frac{p(h_2)}{p(h_1)} \\times \\text{ bayes factor }(h_2;h_1) \\end{align} where \\begin{align} \\text{ bayes factor }(h_1; h_2) = \\frac{p(y|h_2)}{p(y|h_2)} = \\frac{\\int p(\\theta_2|h_2) p(y|\\theta_2, h_2) d\\theta_2}{\\int p(\\theta_1|h_1) p(y|\\theta_1, h_1) d\\theta_1} \\end{align} the bayes factor is only defined when the marginal density of \\(y\\) under each model is proper. this bayesian approach might sound good, but we usually don't recommend it. that's because the likelihood of the data given the model can be strongly influenced by parts of the model that are chosen somewhat arbitrarily and can't be tested with data. bayes factors can work well when the underlying model is truly discrete and for which it makes sense to consider one or the other model as being a good description of the data. we illustrate with an example from genetics. example: a discrete example in which bayes factors are helpful in the genetics example we talked about earlier, we can use bayes factors to help us make sense of things. imagine we have two possible scenarios: \\(h_1\\), where the woman is affected, and \\(h_2\\), where she's not affected. we can represent these scenarios using some numbers. for example, let's say \\(\\theta = 1\\) means she's affected, and \\(\\theta = 0\\) means she's not. now, let's say before we look at any data, we're equally likely to believe either scenario. so, the odds of h2 compared to h1 are 1 to 1, that is \\(\\frac{p(h_2)}{p(h_1)} = 1\\). then, when we look at the data and find out the woman has two unaffected sons, the data is \\(4\\) times more likely under \\(h_2\\) than under \\(h_1\\). that is \\(\\frac{p(y|h_2)}{p(y|h_1)} = \\frac{1.0}{0.25}\\). the posterior odds are thus \\(\\frac{p(h_2|y)}{p(h_1|y)} = 4\\) this example is helpful for bayes factors because the scenarios we're comparing make sense scientifically, and there are no other possible scenarios in between. also, the way the data fits with each scenario makes sense and gives us clear results. bayes factors don't work as well for models that are continuous. for instance, if we're looking at something like the effectiveness of a treatment, which can vary along a scale, it doesn't make sense to assign a probability to it being exactly zero. similarly, if we're comparing different models in regression, like deciding which variables to include, it's better to have all the possible variables in our consideration. we can then use a prior distribution to decide how much to trust each variable, even if we think some might not have much impact. to show why bayes factors struggle with continuous models, let's consider the example of the 8 schools problem, comparing the no-pooling and complete-pooling models. example. a continuous example where bayes factors are a distraction suppose we had analyzed the data from the 8 schools using bayes factors for the discrete collection of previously proposed standard models, no pooling (\\(h_1\\)) and complete pooling (\\(h_2\\)): \\begin{align} h_1: p(y|\\theta_1, \\cdots, \\theta_j) = \\prod_{j=1}^j text{n}(y_j|\\theta_j, \\sigma_j^2), p(\\theta_1, \\cdots, \\theta_j) \\propto 1 \\end{align} \\begin{align} h_2: p(y|\\theta_1, \\cdots, \\theta_j) = \\prod_{j=1}^j text{n}(y_j|\\theta_j, \\sigma_j^2), \\theta_1 = \\cdots = \\theta_j = \\theta \\propto 1 \\end{align} if we try to use bayes factors to pick or combine these models, we run into a problem. the bayes factor, which is the ratio of how likely the data is under one model compared to another, isn't defined here. that's because the prior distributions we're using are improper, which means they don't behave properly in the calculations. specifically, when we try to divide one function by another, we end up with \\(\\frac{0}{0}\\), which doesn't give us a clear answer. so, if we want to stick with the idea of assigning probabilities to these two specific models, we have two options: either use proper prior distributions or carefully construct improper ones in a way that makes sense. however, no matter which route we take, the results won't be very satisfying. more explicitly, suppose we replace the flat prior distributions in \\(h_1\\) and \\(h_2\\) by independent normal prior distributions, \\(\\text{n}(0, a^2)\\), for some large \\(a\\). the resulting posterior distribution for the effect in school \\(j\\) is: \\begin{align} p(\\theta_j|y) = (1 - \\lambda)p(\\theta_j|y, h_1) + \\lambda p(\\theta_j|y, h_2) \\end{align} the bayes factor, which compares how likely the data is under different models, is very sensitive to the prior variance, which is represented by \\(a^2\\). as we increase \\(a\\) (while keeping the data and prior odds fixed), the results tend to favor one model over the other more strongly. this means that bayes factors can't be reliably used with non-informative prior densities, even if we carefully define them in certain ways. another problem with bayes factors in this example is that they behave differently as we change the number of schools in the model. the results can vary significantly depending on how many schools are included, which doesn't make much sense from a scientific perspective. so, if we were to use bayes factors here, we'd likely run into issues during the model-checking stage, where we compare the model's predictions to what we know from real-world knowledge. instead, it might be better to use a smoother, continuous family of models that bridges the gap between the extreme models. this continuous model doesn't assign discrete probabilities to extreme values that don't make scientific sense. $(\"pre\").each(function (index, item) { $(item).html(\"<code>\" + $(item).html() + \"</code>\"); }); hljs.highlightall(); "

    "body": " index search search back measures of predictive accuracy we begin by considering different ways of defining the accuracy or error of a modelâs predictions then discuss methods for estimating predictive accuracy or error from data. preferably, the measure of predictive accuracy is specifically tailored for the application at hand, and it measures as correctly as possible the benefit (or cost) of predicting future data with the model. point prediction in point prediction (predictive point estimation or point forecasting) a single value is reported as a prediction of the unknown future observation. measures of predictive accuracy for point prediction are called scoring functions. for example, the mean squared error: \\begin{align} \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\mathbb{e}[y_i|\\theta])^2 \\end{align} or its weighted version: \\begin{align} \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{(y_i - \\mathbb{e}[y_i|\\theta])^2}{\\mathbb{v}[y_i|\\theta]} \\end{align} these are easy to compute but they are less appropiated for models that are far from the normal distribution. probabilistic prediction in probabilistic prediction (probabilistic forecasting) the aim is to report inferences about \\(\\hat{y}\\) in such a way that the full uncertainty over \\(\\hat{y}\\) is taken into account. these are called scoring rules. examples include the quadratic, logarithmic, and zero-one scores good scoring rules for prediction are: proper: the scoring rule encourages the decision maker to be honest when reporting their beliefs. local: the scoring rule takes into account the fact that some predictions may be worse than others, and it adjusts accordingly. for example the log predictive density or log-likelihood, \\(p(y|\\theta)\\), which is proportional to the mean squared error if the model is normal with constant variance. why not use the log posterior? the answer is that we are interested here in summarizing the fit of model to data, and for this purpose the prior is relevant in estimating the parameters but not inassessing a model's accuracy. we are not saying that the prior cannot be used in assessing a model's fit to data; rather we say that the prior density is not relevant in computing predictive accuracy. predictive accuracy for a single data point the best way to measure how well a model fits is by seeing how accurately it predicts outcomes in new data that it hasn't seen before (out-of-sample predictive performance), but that comes from the same process as the original data. we label \\(f\\) as the true model, \\(y\\) as the observed data and \\(\\tilde{y}\\) as future data. the out-of-sample predictive fit for a new data point \\(\\tilde{y}_i\\) using logarithmic score is: \\begin{align} \\log p_{\\text{post}}(\\tilde{y}_i) = \\log \\mathbb{e}_{\\text{post}}[p(\\tilde{y}_i|\\theta)] = \\end{align} by the definition of the expected value for a random variable: \\begin{align} = \\log \\int p(\\tilde{y}_i|\\theta) p_{\\text{post}}(\\theta)d\\theta \\end{align} where \\(p_{\\text{post}}(\\tilde{y}_i)\\) is the predictive density for \\(\\tilde{y}_i\\) induced by the posterior distribution \\(p_{\\text{post}}(\\theta)\\). note that we use \\(p_{\\text{post}}\\) and \\(\\mathbb{e}_{\\text{post}}\\) to denote any probability or expectation that averages over the posterior distribution of \\(\\theta\\). averaging over the distribution of future data the future data \\(\\tilde{y}_i\\) are themselves unknown and thus we define the expected out-of-sample log predictive density. by the definition of expected value of the function \\(\\log (x)\\) over \\(\\tilde{y}\\) with respect to a function \\(f\\) that describes the distribution of the data, we compute the expected log predictive density or elpd for a new data point as follows: \\begin{align} \\mathbb{e}_f[\\log p_{\\text{post}}(\\tilde{y}_i)] = \\int \\log (p_{\\text{post}}(\\tilde{y}_i)) f(\\tilde{y}_i) d\\tilde{y} \\end{align} in general we do not know the data distribution \\(f\\). a natural way to estimate the expected out-of-sample log predictive density would be to plug in an estimate for \\(f\\), but this will tend to imply too good a fit. for now we consider the estimation of predictive accuracy in a bayesian context. one can define a measure of predictive accuracy for the \\(n\\) data points taken one at a time: \\begin{align} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathbb{e}_f[\\log(p_{\\text{post}}(\\tilde{y}_i))] \\end{align} this gives us the expected log pointwise predictive density for a new dataset. using a single-point measure instead of dealing with the entire set of predictions (the joint distribution \\(p_{\\text{post}}(\\tilde{y})\\)) allows us to connect it to cross-validation, which helps us approximate how well our model performs on new data based on the data we already have. it is sometimes useful to consider predictive accuracy given a point estimate \\(\\theta(\\tilde{y})\\) (sampled data point given the parameter \\(\\theta\\)?). this gives us the expected log predictive density given \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\): \\begin{align} \\mathbb{e}_f[\\log(p(\\tilde{y}|\\theta))] \\end{align} evaluating predictive accuracy for a fitted model in practice the parameter \\(\\theta\\) is not known, so we cannot know the log predictive density \\(\\log p(y|\\theta)\\), which tells us how well our model predicts new data based on \\(\\theta\\). so, instead of using \\(\\theta\\) directly, we use something called the posterior distribution, denoted as \\(p_{\\text{post}}(\\theta) = p(\\theta|y)\\). this distribution gives us a range of possible values for \\(\\theta\\) based on the data we have. from this distribution, we can summarize how accurately our model predicts new data. so we define the log pointwise predictive density or lppd as: \\begin{align} \\log \\prod_{i=1}^n p_{\\text{post}}(y_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\log \\int p(y_i|\\theta)p_{\\text{post}}(\\theta)d\\theta \\end{align} to calculate this predictive density, we can use samples drawn from the posterior distribution \\(p_{\\text{post}}(\\theta)\\) using simulation. these samples are labeled as \\(\\theta_s\\), where \\(s\\) ranges from \\(1\\) to \\(s\\). so we define the computed log pointwise predictive density or computed lppd as: \\begin{align} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\log \\left(\\frac{1}{s}\\sum_{s=1}^s p(y_i|\\theta^s)\\right) \\end{align} we basically compute the sample mean of the likelihood \\(p(y_i|\\theta)\\) for over all the \\(\\{\\theta^s\\}_{s=1}^s\\) we typically assume that the number of simulation draws \\(s\\) is large enough to fully capture the posterior distribution. the lppd of observed data y is an overestimate of the elppd for future data. hence the plan is to start with lppd and then apply some sort of bias correction to get a reasonable estimate of elppd. $(\"pre\").each(function (index, item) { $(item).html(\"<code>\" + $(item).html() + \"</code>\");

    "title": "Gibbs Sampler",
    "body": " index search search back gibbs sampler introduction many smart techniques have been developed to create and sample from different types of posterior distributions. one common method is called markov chain simulation, also known as markov chain monte carlo (mcmc). it works by first drawing values of a parameter (usually denoted as \\(\\theta\\)) from rough estimates of the distribution, and then adjusting those draws to better match the actual distribution we're interested in, called the posterior distribution, denoted as \\(p(\\theta|y)\\). the drawing process is done step by step, with each draw depending on the previous one, forming what's called a markov chain. figure 11.1 shows a simple example of markov chain simulation, using what's called a metropolis algorithm. imagine we have a parameter called \\(\\theta\\) that is a vector with two components, such that \\(\\theta \\sim \\text{n}(0, i)\\). now, let's look at figure 11.1a, which shows the early steps of this simulation. the picture represents all the possible values that \\(\\theta\\) can take, and each of the five squiggly lines shows the path taken by a random walk. these random walks start either near the center or at the edges of the distribution and move around based on a series of random steps. in figure 11.1b, we see the later stages of the same simulation. each of the random walks has now traced a path throughout the entire space of possible \\(\\theta\\) values. they've settled into a common pattern, which matches the target distribution we're interested in. finally, in figure 11.1c, we can use the information gathered from the second halves of these simulated random walks to make inferences about \\(\\theta\\). in our use of markov chain simulation, we create multiple separate sequences. each sequence starts from a particular point, like \\(\\theta_0\\), and then we move step by step, drawing a new value \\(\\theta_t\\) from a transition distribution \\(t_t(\\theta_t|\\theta_{tâ1})\\), which depends on the previous draw. markov chain simulation is used when it is not possible to sample \\(\\theta\\) directly from \\(p(\\theta|y)\\) instead we sample iteratively in such a way that at each step of the process we expect to draw from a distribution that becomes closer to \\(p(\\theta|y)\\). once the simulation algorithm has been implemented and the simulations drawn, it is absolutely necessary to check the convergence of the simulated sequences; for example, the simulations of figure 11.1a are far from convergence and are not close to the target distribution. gibbs sampler imagine you have a \\(d\\)-dimensional parameter vector \\(\\theta\\) that's been split into smaller parts, such that \\(\\theta = (\\theta_1, \\cdots, \\theta_d)\\). each time the gibbs sampler runs, it goes through each of the dimensions, one at a time, while keeping the rest fixed. so, if there are \\(d\\) dimensions, there are \\(d\\) steps in each iteration \\(t\\). at each iteration, we pick an order for the \\(d\\) parts of \\(\\theta\\). then, we go through each part one by one and we sample a new value for each part based on the current values of all the other parts. this continues for each part until we've updated all of them once, and then we start the process over again for the next iteration. \\begin{align} p(\\theta_j|\\theta_{-j}^{t-1}, y) \\end{align} where \\(\\theta_{-j}^{t-1}\\) represents all the components of \\(\\theta\\) except for \\(\\theta_j\\) at their current values: \\begin{align} \\theta_{-j}^{t - 1} = (\\theta_1^t, \\cdots, \\theta^t_{j - 1}, \\theta_{j + 1}^{t - 1}, \\theta_{d}^{t - 1}) \\end{align} thus, each subvector \\(\\theta_j\\) is updated conditional on the latest values of the other components of \\(\\theta\\), which are the iteration \\(t\\) values for the components already updated and the iteration \\(t â 1\\) values for the others. here, we illustrate the workings of the gibbs sampler with a simple example. example: bivariate normal distribution consider a single observation \\((y_1, y_2)\\) from a bivariate normally distributed population with unknown mean \\(\\theta = (\\theta_1, \\theta_2)\\) and known covariance matrix \\(\\begin{bmatrix}1 & \\rho \\\\ \\rho & 1\\end{bmatrix}\\). with a uniform prior distribution on \\(\\theta\\), the posterior distribution is: \\begin{align} \\begin{bmatrix} \\theta_1 \\\\ \\theta_2 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} | y \\sim \\text{n}(\\begin{bmatrix} y_1 \\\\ y_2 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}, \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & \\rho \\\\ \\rho & 1 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}) \\end{align} we need the conditional posterior distributions, which, from the properties of the multivariate normal distribution, are: \\begin{align} \\theta_1 |\\theta_2, y \\sim \\text{n}(y_1 + \\rho(\\theta_2 - y_2), 1 - \\rho^2) \\end{align} \\begin{align} \\theta_2 |\\theta_1, y \\sim \\text{n}(y_2 + \\rho(\\theta_1 - y_1), 1 - \\rho^2) \\end{align} the gibbs sampler proceeds by alternately sampling from these two normal distributions. figure 11.2 illustrates for the case \\(\\rho = 0.8\\), data \\((y_1, y_2) = (0, 0)\\), and four independent sequences started at \\((\\pm 2.5, \\pm 2.5)\\). $(\"pre\").each(function (index, item) { $(item).html(\"<code>\" + $(item).html() + \"</code>\");

    "title": "Effective Number of Simulation Draws",
    "body": " index search search back effective number of simulation draws one way to define effective sample size for correlated simulation draws is to consider the statistical efficiency of the average of the simulations \\(\\overline{\\psi}_{..}\\), as an estimate of the posterior mean, \\(\\mathbb{e}[\\psi|y]\\). this might be inappropriate, for example, if there is particular interest in accurate representation of low-probability events in the tails of the distribution. continuing with this definition, it is usual to compute effective sample size using the following asymptotic formula for the variance of the average of a correlated sequence: \\begin{align} \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} mn \\mathbb{v}[\\overline{\\psi}_{..}] = \\left(1 + 2 \\sum_{t = 1}^{\\infty} \\rho_t\\right) \\mathbb{v}[\\psi|y] \\end{align} where \\(\\rho_t\\) is the autocorrelation of the sequence \\(\\psi\\) at \\(t\\). in the presence of correlation we then define the effective sample size as: \\begin{align} n_{eff} = \\frac{mn}{1 + 2 \\sum_{t = 1}^{\\infty} \\rho_t} \\end{align} the asymptotic nature of the previous equations might seem disturbing given that in reality we will only have a finite simulation, but this should not be a problem given that we already want to run the simulations long enough for approximate convergence to the (asymptotic) target distribution. we then estimate the correlations as: \\begin{align} \\hat{\\rho}_t = 1 - \\frac{v_t}{2 \\overline{\\mathbb{v}}^+} \\end{align} where: \\begin{align} v_t = \\frac{1}{m(n - t)} \\sum_{j=1}^m \\sum_{i = t+1}^n (\\psi_{i,j} - \\psi_{i - t, j})^2 \\end{align} unfortunately we cannot simply sum all of these to estimate \\(n_{eff}\\) given that for large values of \\(t\\) the sample correlation \\(\\psi_t\\) is too noisy. instead we compute a partial sum, starting from \\(t = 0\\) and continuing until the sum of autocorrelation estimates for two successive iterationsis negative: \\begin{align} \\hat{n}_{eff} = \\frac{mn}{1 + 2 \\sum_{t = 1}^t \\hat{\\rho}_t} \\end{align} all these calculations should be performed using only the saved iterations, after discarding the warm-up period. bounded or long-tailed distributions the above convergence diagnostics are based on means and variances, and they will not work so well for parameters or scalar summaries for which the posterior distribution, \\(p(\\phi|y)\\), is far from gaussian. for summaries \\(\\phi\\) whose distributions are constrained or otherwise far from normal, we can preprocess simulations using transformations before computing the potential scale reduction factor \\(\\hat{r}\\) and the effective sample size \\(\\hat{n}_{eff}\\). stopping the simulations we monitor convergence for the entire multivariate distribution, \\(p(\\theta|y)\\), by computing the potential scale reduction factor \\(\\hat{r}\\) and the effective sample size \\(\\hat{n}_{eff}\\) for each scalar summary of interest. we recommend computing the potential scale reduction for all scalar estimands of interest; if \\(\\hat{r}\\) is not near \\(1\\) for all of them, continue the simulation runs. we can use effective sample size \\(\\hat{n}_{eff}\\) to give us a sense of the precision obtained from our simulations. as a default rule, we suggest running the simulation until \\(\\hat{n}_{eff}\\) is at least \\(5m\\), that is, until there are the equivalent of at least \\(10\\) independent draws per sequence. for some purposes, more precision will be desired, and then a higher effective sample size threshold can be used. once \\(\\hat{r}\\) is near \\(1\\) and \\(\\hat{n}_{eff}\\) is more than \\(10\\) per chain for all scalar estimands of interest, just collect the \\(mn\\) simulations (with warm-up iterations already excluded) and treat them as a sample from the target distribution. even if an iterative simulation appears to converge and has passed all tests of convergence, it still may actually be far from convergence if important areas of the target distribution were not captured by the starting distribution and are not easily reachable by the simulation algorithm. when we declare approximate convergence, we are actually concluding that each individual sequence appears stationary and that the observed sequences have mixed well with each other. these checks are not hypothesis tests. there is no p-value and no statistical significance. $(\"pre\").each(function (index, item) { $(item).html(\"<code>\" + $(item).html() + \"</code>\"); }); hljs.highlightall(); "

    "title": "Inference and Assessing Convergence",
    "body": " index search search back inference and assessing convergence the basic method of inference from iterative simulation is the same as for bayesian simulation in general: use the collection of all the simulated draws from \\(p(\\theta|y)\\) to summarize the posterior density and to compute quantiles, moments, and other summaries of interest as needed. difficulties of inference from iterative simulation iterative simulation adds two challenges to simulation inference: if the iterations have not proceeded long enough the simulations may be unrepresentative of the target distribution (figure 11.1a) the iterative simulation draws present within-sequence correlation. serial correlation in the simulations is not necessarily a problem because, at convergence, the draws are identically distributed as \\(p(\\theta|y)\\). but such correlation can cause inefficiencies in simulations. we handle these problems as follows: we design the simulation runs to allow effective monitoring of convergence by simulating multiple sequences with starting points dispersed throughout parameter space. we monitor the convergence of all quantities of interest by comparing variation between and within simulated sequences until \"within\" variation roughly equals \"between\" variation. only when the distribution of each simulated sequence is close to the distribution of all the sequences mixed together can they all be approximating the target distribution. if the simulation efficiency is low, the algorithm may be altered. discarding early iterations of the simulation runs to diminish the influence of the starting values, we discard the first half of each sequence and focus attention on the second half. so our inferences will be based on the assumption that the distributions of the simulated values \\(\\theta_t\\), for large enough \\(t\\), are close to the target distribution, \\(p(\\theta|y)\\). we refer to the practice of discarding early iterations in markov chain simulation as warm-up. depending on the context, different warm-up fractions (number of elements on the sequence to discard) can be appropriate. dependence of the iterations in each sequence once approximate convergence has been reached, is whether to thin the sequences by keeping every \\(k\\)th simulation draw from each sequence and discarding the rest. whether or not the sequences are thinned, if the sequences have reached approximate convergence, they can be directly used for inferences about the parameters \\(\\theta\\) and any other quantities of interest. multiple sequences with overdispersed starting points our recommended approach to assessing convergence of iterative simulation is based on comparing different simulated sequences, as illustrated in figure 11.1. in figure 11.1a, the multiple sequences clearly have not converged; the variance within each sequence is much less than the variance between sequences. later, in figure 11.1b, the sequences have mixed, and the two variance components are essentially equal. monitoring scalar estimands we monitor each scalar estimand or other scalar quantities of interest separately. estimands include all the parameters of interest in the model and any other quantities of interest (for example, the ratio of two parameters or the value of a predicted future observation). it is often useful also to monitor the value of the logarithm of the posterior density, which has probably already been computed if we are using a version of the metropolis algorithm. challenges of monitoring convergence: mixing and stationarity figure 11.3a illustrates that, to achieve convergence, the sequences must together have mixed. the second graph in figure 11.3 shows two chains that have mixed, in the sense that they have traced out a common distribution, but they do not appear to have converged. figure 11.3b illustrates that, to achieve convergence, each individual sequence must reach stationarity. so to check convergence we have to simultaneously tests mixing (if all the chains have mixed well, the separate parts of the different chains should also mix) and stationarity (at stationarity, the first and second half of each sequence should be traversing the same distribution). splitting each saved sequence into two parts we diagnose convergence (as noted above, separately for each scalar quantity of interest) by checking mixing and stationarity. our approach consists on splitting each chain in half and check that all the resulting halfsequences have mixed. we start with some number of simulated sequences in which the warm-up period has already been discarded. we then take each of these chains and split into the first and second half. let \\(m\\) be the number of chains (after splitting) and \\(n\\) be the length of each chain. for example, suppose we simulate \\(5\\) chains, each of length \\(1000\\), and then discard the first half of each as warm-up. we are then left with \\(5\\) chains, each of length \\(500\\), and we split each into two parts: iterations \\(1â250\\) (originally iterations \\(501â750\\)) and iterations \\(251â500\\) (originally iterations \\(751â1000\\)). we now have \\(m = 10\\) chains, each of length \\(n = 250\\). assessing mixing using between- and within-sequence variances for each scalar estimand \\(\\psi\\), we label the simulations as \\(\\psi_{ij}, (i = 1, \\cdots, n; j = 1, \\cdots, m)\\), and we compute \\(b\\) and \\(w\\), the between- and within-sequence variances: \\begin{align} b = \\frac{n}{m - 1} \\sum_{j=1}^m (\\overline{\\psi}_{.j} - \\overline{\\psi}_{..})^2 \\end{align} where: \\begin{align} \\overline{\\psi}_{.j} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\psi_{ij} \\end{align} \\begin{align} \\overline{\\psi}_{..} = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{j=1}^m \\overline{\\psi}_{.j} \\end{align} and \\begin{align} w = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{j=1}^m s_{j}^2 \\end{align} where \\begin{align} s^2_j = \\frac{1}{n - 1} \\sum_{i = 1}^n (\\psi_{ij} - \\overline{\\psi}_{.j})^2 \\end{align} we can estimate \\(\\mathbb{v}[\\psi|y]\\), the marginal posterior variance of the estimand, by a weighted average of \\(w\\) and \\(b\\), namely: \\begin{align} \\hat{\\mathbb{v}}^+[\\psi|y] = \\frac{n - 1}{n}w + \\frac{1}{n} b \\end{align} this quantity overestimates the marginal posterior variance assuming the starting distribution is appropriately overdispersed, but is unbiased under stationarity. meanwhile, for any finite \\(n\\), the \"within\" variance \\(w\\) should be an underestimate of \\(\\mathbb{v}[\\psi|y]\\) because the individual sequences have not had time to range over all of the target distribution and, as a result, will have less variability; in the limit as \\(n \\rightarrow \\infty\\), the expectation of \\(w\\) approaches \\(\\mathbb{v}[\\psi|y]\\). we monitor convergence of the iterative simulation by estimating the factor by which the scale of the current distribution for \\(\\psi\\) might be reduced if the simulations were continued in the limit \\(n \\rightarrow \\infty\\). this potential scale reduction is estimated by: \\begin{align} \\hat{r} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{\\mathbb{v}}[\\psi|y]}{w}} \\end{align} which declines to \\(1\\) as \\(n \\rightarrow 1\\). if the potential scale reduction is high, then we have reason to believe that proceeding with further simulations may improve our inference about the target distribution of the associated scalar estimand. example. bivariate unit normal density with bivariate normal jumping kernel (continued) table 11.1 displays posterior inference for the two parameters of the distribution as well as the log posterior density. after \\(50\\) iterations, the variance between the five sequences is much greater than the variance within, for all three univariate summaries considered. however, the five simulated sequences have converged adequately after \\(2000\\) or certainly \\(5000\\) iterations for the quantities of interest. the comparison with the true target distribution shows how some variability remains in the posterior inferences even after the markov chains have converged. the method of monitoring convergence presented here has the key advantage of not requiring the user to examine time series graphs of simulated sequences. inspection of such plots is a notoriously unreliable method. $(\"pre\").each(function (index, item) { $(item).html(\"<code>\" + $(item).html() + \"</code>\");

    "title": "Metropolis and Metropolis-Hastings Algorithms",
    "body": " index search search back metropolis and metropolis-hastings algorithms the metropolis-hastings algorithm is a general term for a family of markov chain simulation methods that are useful for sampling from bayesian posterior distributions. we have already seen the gibbs sampler in the previous section; it can be viewed as a special case of metropolis-hastings. the metropolis algorithm the metropolis algorithm is an adaptation of a random walk with an acceptance/rejection rule to converge to the specified target distribution. the algorithm proceeds as follows. draw a starting point \\(\\theta_0\\), for which \\(p(\\theta_0|y) > 0\\), from a starting distribution \\(p_0(\\theta)\\). the starting distribution might be based on an approximation or we may simply choose starting values dispersed around a crude approximate estimate. for \\(t = 1, 2, \\cdots\\): sample a proposal \\(\\theta^*\\) from a jumping distribution (or proposal distribution) at time \\(t\\), \\(j_t(\\theta^*|\\theta^{t-1})\\). for the metropolis algorithm (but not the metropolis-hastings algorithm, as discussed later in this section), the jumping distribution must be symmetric. calculate the ratio of the densities: \\begin{align} r = \\frac{p(\\theta^*|y)}{p(\\theta^{t- 1}|y)} \\end{align} set: \\begin{align} \\theta^t = \\begin{cases} \\theta^* & \\text{ with probability } \\min(r, 1) \\\\ \\theta^{t-1} \\text{ otherwise } \\end{cases} \\end{align} the acceptance/rejection rule of the metropolis algorithm can be stated as follows: if the jump increases the posterior density, set \\(\\theta^t = \\theta^*\\); if the jump decreases the posterior density, set \\(\\theta^t = \\theta^*\\) with probability equal to the density ratio, \\(r\\), otherwise set \\(\\theta_t = \\theta^{t - 1}\\) (with probability \\(1 - r\\)). the metropolis algorithm can thus be viewed as a stochastic version of a stepwise mode-finding algorithm, always accepting steps that increase the density but only sometimes accepting downward steps. to use the algorithm, we need to calculate the ratio \\(r\\) for every pair of \\((\\theta, \\theta^*)\\), and we also need to choose \\(\\theta\\) from the jumping distribution \\(j_t(\\theta^*|\\theta)\\) for all \\(\\theta\\) and \\(t\\). additionally, we need to generate a random number for step (\\(c\\)) in the process. even if the jump isn't accepted and \\(\\theta_t\\) equals \\(\\theta_{t-1}\\), it still counts as a step in the algorithm. example: bivariate unit normal density with normal jumping kernel for simplicity, we illustrate the metropolis algorithm with the simple example of the bivariate unit normal distribution. the target density is the bivariate unit normal, \\(p(\\theta|y) = \\text{n}(\\theta|0, i)\\). the jumping distribution is also bivariate normal, centered at the current iteration and scaled to \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) the size: \\(j_t(\\theta^*|\\theta^{tâ1}) = \\text{n}(\\theta^*|\\theta^{tâ1}, 0.22\\cdot i)\\). at each step, it is easy to calculate the density ratio: \\[ r = \\frac{\\text{n}(\\theta^*|0, i)}{\\text{n}(\\theta^{t-1}|0, i)} \\] it is clear from the form of the normal distribution that the jumping rule is symmetric. figure 11.1 displays five simulation runs starting from different points. we have purposely set the scale of this jumping algorithm to be too small, relative to the target distribution, so that the algorithm will run inefficiently and its random-walk aspect will be obvious in the figure. why does the metropolis algorithm work? the proof that the sequence of iterations \\(\\theta_1, \\theta_2, \\cdots\\) converges to the target distribution has two steps: it is shown that the simulated sequence is a markov chain with a unique stationary distribution. it is shown that the stationary distribution equals the target distribution. except for trivial exceptions, the latter two conditions hold for a random walk on any proper distribution, and irreducibility holds as long as the jumping distributions jt is eventually be able to jump to all states with positive probability. to show (1) consider starting the algorithm at time \\(t â 1\\) with a draw \\(\\theta^{tâ1}\\) from the target distribution \\(p(\\theta|y)\\). now consider any two such points \\(\\theta_a\\) and \\(\\theta_b\\), drawn from \\(p(\\theta|y)\\) and labeled so that \\(p(\\theta_b|y) \\geq p(\\theta_a|y)\\). the unconditional probability density of a transition from \\(\\theta_a\\) to \\(\\theta_b\\) is: \\begin{align} p(\\theta^{t - 1} = \\theta_a, \\theta^t = \\theta_b) = p(\\theta_a|y)j_t(\\theta_b|\\theta_a) \\end{align} where the acceptance probability is \\(1\\) because of our labeling of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the unconditional probability density of a transition from \\(\\theta_b\\) to \\(\\theta_a\\) is: \\begin{align} p(\\theta^t = \\theta_a, \\theta^{t-1} = \\theta_b) = p(\\theta_b|y)j_t(\\theta_a|\\theta_b) \\left(\\frac{p(\\theta_a|y)}{p(\\theta_b|y)}\\right) \\end{align} \\begin{align} = p(\\theta_b|y)j_t(\\theta_a|\\theta_b) \\end{align} which is the same as the probability of a transition from \\(\\theta_a\\) to \\(\\theta_b\\), since we have required that \\(j_t(\\cdot|\\cdot)\\) be symmetric. since their joint distribution is symmetric, \\(\\theta^t\\) and \\(\\theta^{tâ1}\\) have the same marginal distributions, and so \\(p(\\theta|y)\\) is the stationary distribution of the markov chain of \\(\\theta\\). the metropolis-hastings algorithm the metropolis-hastings algorithm generalizes the basic metropolis algorithm presented above in two ways. the jumping rules \\(j_t\\) need no longer be symmetric. to correct for the asymmetry in the jumping rule the ratio \\(r\\) is replaced by a ratio of ratios: \\begin{align} r = \\frac{\\frac{p(\\theta^*|y)}{j_t(\\theta^*|\\theta^{t-1})}}{\\frac{p(\\theta^{t-1}|y)}{j_t(\\theta^{t-1}|\\theta^*)}} \\end{align} allowing asymmetric jumping rules can be useful in increasing the speed of the random walk. relation between the jumping rule and efficiency of simulations the ideal metropolis-hastings jumping rule is simply to sample the proposal, \\(\\theta^*\\), from the target distribution; such that our jumping distribution is equal to the target distribution, \\(j(\\theta^*|\\theta) â¡ p(\\theta^*|y)\\). then the ratio \\(r\\) is always exactly \\(1\\), so we always choose the new sampled \\(\\theta^*\\) to update \\(\\theta^t\\) instead of remaining with \\(\\theta^{t-1}\\). a good jumping distribution has the following properties: for any \\(\\theta\\), it is easy to sample from \\(j(\\theta^*|\\theta)\\) it is easy to compute the ratio \\(r\\) each jump goes a reasonable distance in the parameter space (otherwise the random walk moves too slowly). the jumps are not rejected too frequently (otherwise the random walk wastes too much time standing still). $(\"pre\").each(function (index, item) { $(item).html(\"<code>\" + $(item).html() + \"</code>\"); }); hljs.highlightall(); "

    "body": " index search search back exchangeability and hierarchical models let \\(e\\) be a set of experiments, such that \\(e_j = {y_i, \\theta_j}, j = 1, \\cdots, j\\) where \\(y_i\\) are the vector data, \\(\\theta_j\\) are the vector parameters and \\(p(y_j|\\theta_j)\\) is the likelihood function. exchangeability when we have no additional data on the parameters, we assume exchangeability between them, such that \\(p(\\theta_1, \\cdots, \\theta_j)\\) is invariant to permutation of the indexes. the simplest form of an exchangeable distribution has each of the parameters \\(\\theta_j\\) as an independent sample from a prior distribution governed by some unknown parameter vector \\(\\phi\\); thus: \\begin{align} p(\\theta|\\phi) = \\prod_{j = 1}^j p(\\theta_j|\\phi) \\end{align} in general, \\(\\phi\\) is unknown, so our distribution for \\(\\theta\\) must average over our uncertainty in \\(\\phi\\): \\begin{align} p(\\theta) = \\int_{\\phi} p(\\theta|\\phi)p(\\phi) d \\phi \\end{align} \\begin{align} = \\int_{\\phi} \\left(\\prod_{j = 1}^j p(\\theta_j|\\phi)\\right) p(\\phi) d \\phi \\end{align} this form, the mixture of independent identical distributions, is usually all that we need to capture exchangeability in practice. example we use a nonhierarchical example with exchangeability at the level of \\(y\\) rather than \\(\\theta\\). in this example, eight states in the united states were selected, and the divorce rate per \\(1000\\) population in each state in \\(1981\\) was recorded. since you have no information to distinguish any of the eight states from the others, you must model them exchangeably. however, you can't assign an exchangeable prior to the set of eight diverse states when there's specific information about one of them. for example, if we know that nevada differentiates itself from the others because it divorce rate is known to be unusually high, that lets us know before even seeing the data (observed values), that there's a strong reason to believe that nevada's divorce rate is higher than the other states. this means that in a bayesian analysis, the prior distribution should reflect this belief, assigning more probability mass to nevada having a higher divorce rate in comparison to the other states. exchangeability when additional information is available on the units sometimes obervations are partially or conditionally exchangeable. for example, when: in the case where observations can be grouped, a hierarchical model can be created. in this context, each group has unknown properties. the assumption of exchangeability allows for the use of a common prior distribution for these group properties, meaning that any group can be considered as a random sample of the same underlying population. if \\(y_i\\) has additional information \\(x_i\\) so that \\(y_i\\) are not exchangeable but \\((y_i, x_i)\\) still are exchangeable, then we can make a joint model for \\((y_i, x_i)\\) or a conditional model for \\(y_i|x_i\\). in general, the usual way to model exchangeability with covariates is through conditional independence: \\begin{align} p(\\theta_1, \\cdots, \\theta_j) = \\int \\left[ p(\\theta_j|\\phi,x_j)\\right]p(\\phi, x) d\\phi \\end{align} whith \\(x = [x_1, \\cdots, x_j]\\) example let's consider an example in the field of education where we want to analyze the test scores of students from different schools. we can view the test scores as observations that can be grouped by schools. let \\(y_{ij}\\) be the test score of the student \\(i\\) in school \\(j\\), where \\(i = 1, 2, \\cdots, n_j\\) and \\(j = 1, 2, \\cdots, j\\) and \\(n_j\\) are the number of students at school \\(j\\). assumptions each school \\(j\\) has an unknown mean test score \\(\\mu_j\\). the mean test scores \\(\\mu_j\\) are assumed to follow a common distribution. *exchangeability: the test scores within each school are exchangeable, implying that any school could be considered a random sample from the overall population of schools. common prior distribution: we assume a common prior distribution for the group mean test scores \\(\\mu_j\\) across schools. model formulation likelihood: the likelihood of the test scores given the group mean and variance \\begin{align} p(y_{ij}|\\mu_j, \\sigma^2) \\end{align} prior: common prior distribution for the group mean test scores \\begin{align} p(\\mu_j|\\theta) \\sim \\mathcal{n}(\\theta, \\tau^2) \\end{align} where \\(\\theta\\) represents the overall mean test score and \\(\\tau\\) is the variance parameter. hyperprior: prior distribution for the overall test score \\begin{align} p(\\theta) \\sim \\mathcal{n}(\\mu_0, \\sigma_0^2) \\end{align} where \\(\\mu_0\\) is the prior mean and \\(\\sigma_0^2\\) is the prior variance. bayesian inference the posterior distribution of the group mean test scores and the overall mean test score can be obtained using bayesian inference techniques, such as markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) sampling. objections to exchangeable models in statistical applications, it is common to raise objections to the assumption that different data or experiments are exchangeable. for example experiments may which may have been conducted at different times, with different subjects, and likely in different places. despite these differences, the text suggests that it might be acceptable to consider the data as if they were from the same distribution due to model ignorance. the full bayesian treatment of the hierarchical model the true 'hierarchical' part of the models is that some parameters are not known and thus have their own prior distributions, denoted as \\(p(\\phi)\\). the bayesian posterior distribution is of the vector \\((\\phi, \\theta)\\). the joint prior distribution is: \\begin{align} p(\\phi, \\theta) = p(\\phi)p(\\theta|\\phi) \\end{align} and the joint posterior distribution (after seeing the data \\(y\\)) is: \\begin{align} p(\\phi, \\theta|y) \\propto p(\\phi, \\theta)p(y|\\phi, \\theta) \\end{align} given that \\(p(y|\\phi, \\theta)\\) depends only on \\(\\theta\\): \\begin{align} = p(\\phi, \\theta)p(y|\\theta) \\end{align} in order to create a joint probability distribution for \\((\\phi, \\theta)\\), we must assign a prior distribution to \\(\\phi\\). it is often practical to start with a simple, relatively noninformative, prior distribution on \\(\\phi\\) and seek to add more prior information if there remains too much variation in the posterior distribution. posterior predictive distributions hierarchical models are characterized both by parameters \\(\\theta\\) and hyperparameters, \\(\\phi\\), that parametrize the prior distribution over \\(\\theta\\). there are two posterior predictive distributions that might be of interest: the distribution of future observations \\(\\tilde{y}\\) corresponding to an existing \\(j\\) \"group\" described by \\(\\theta_j\\). the distribution of future observations \\(\\tilde{y}\\) corresponding to future \\(\\theta_j\\) (a \"new group\"), denoted by \\(\\tilde{\\theta}\\), drawn from the superpopulation \\(p(\\theta|\\phi)\\). in the rat tumor example, future observations can be (1) additional rats from an existing experiment, or (2) results from a future experiment (explained by a different set of parameters \\(\\theta\\)). for (1) the posterior predictive draws \\(\\tilde{y}\\) are based on the posterior draws of \\(\\theta_j\\) (\\(p(\\theta_j|y)\\)) for the existing experiment. for (2) one must first draw \\(\\tilde{\\theta}\\) for the new experiment from the population distribution, given the posterior draws of \\(\\phi\\), and then draw \\(\\tilde{y}\\) given the simulated \\(\\tilde{\\theta}\\).

    "title": "Example: parallel experiments in eight schools",
    "body": " index search search back example: parallel experiments in eight schools a study was performed for the educational testing service to analyze the effects of special coaching programs on test scores in each of eigth schools. the outcome variable in each study was the score on a special administration of the sat-v. the scores can vary between \\(200\\) and \\(800\\), with mean about \\(500\\) and standard deviation about \\(100\\). also, there was no prior reason to believe that any of the eight programs was more effective than any other or that some were more similar in effect to each other than to any other. the results of the experiments are summarized in: inferences based on nonhierarchical models and their problems before fitting the hierarchical bayesian model, we first consider two simpler nonhierarchical methodsâestimating the effects from the eight experiments independently (separate estimates), and complete poolingâand discuss why neither of these approaches is adequate for this example. consider \\(\\theta_1\\), the effect in school \\(a\\). the effect in school \\(a\\) is estimated as \\(28.4\\) with a standard error of \\(14.9\\) under the separate analysis, versus a pooled estimate of \\(7.7\\) with a standard error of \\(4.1\\) under the common-effect model. note: given a normal distribution (symmetrical with respect to it mean) the probability that an estimate takes a value under the mean is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) (cumulative density function), as the \\(\\mu\\) serves as the midpoint of a normal distribution such that half the area for the normal curve is contained under \\([0, \\mu]\\). the separate analyses of the eight schools imply the following posterior statement: 'the probability is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) that the true effect in \\(a\\) is more than \\(28.4\\)' a doubtful statement, considering the results for the other seven schools. on the other hand, the pooled model implies the following statement: 'the probability is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) that the true effect in a is less than \\(7.7\\),' which seems an inaccurate summary of our knowledge. as in the theoretical discussion of the previous section, neither estimate is fully satisfactory, and we would like a compromise that combines information from all eight experiments without assuming all the \\(\\theta_j\\)'s to be equal. the bayesian analysis under the hierarchical model provides exactly that. posterior simulation under the hierarchical model consequently, we compute the posterior distribution of \\(\\theta_1, \\cdots, \\theta_8\\), based on the normal model presented in section 4. we draw from the posterior distribution for the bayesian model by simulating the random variables \\(\\tau\\), \\(\\mu\\), and \\(\\theta\\), in that order, from their posterior distribution, as discussed at the end of the previous section. the sampling standard deviations, \\(\\sigma_j\\), are assumed known and equal to the values in table 5.2, and we assume independent uniform prior densities on \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\tau\\). the marginal posterior density function, \\(p(\\tau|y)\\) from, is plotted in the next figure: values of \\(\\tau\\) near zero are mos plausible. in the normal hierarchical model, however, we learn a great deal by considering the conditional posterior distributions given \\(\\tau\\) (and averaged over \\(\\mu\\)), that is \\(\\mathbb{e}[\\theta_j|\\tau, y]\\), averaging over \\(\\mu\\). this is displayed on the following image: comparing with the previous figure, which has the same scale on the horizontal axis, we see that for most of the likely values of \\(\\tau\\), that is for \\(\\tau \\approx 0\\) the estimated effects for all the groups are relatively close together (when \\(\\tau = 0\\) you would guess they are clustered on the same point). however, as \\(\\tau\\) becomes larger, corresponding to more variability among schools, the estimates become more like the raw values shown on the first figure of this section. the lines in the following figure show the conditional standard deviations, \\(sd(\\theta_j|\\tau, y)\\), as a function of \\(\\tau\\). as \\(\\tau\\) increases, the population distribution allows the eight effects to be more different from each other, and hence the posterior uncertainty in each individual \\(\\tau_j\\) increases, approaching the standard deviations shown in the raw data in the limit of \\(\\tau \\rightarrow \\infty\\). contrary to what we saw with separate estimates and pooled estimates, for the likely values of \\(\\tau\\) (see figure for \\(p(\\tau|y)\\)), the estimates in all schools are substantially less than \\(28\\) points. for example, even at \\(\\tau = 0\\), the probability that the effect in school a is less than \\(28\\) points is \\(\\phi[(28 â 14.5)/9.1] = 93\\%\\), where \\(\\phi\\) is the standard normal cumulative distribution function. of substantial importance, we do not obtain an accurate summary of the data if we condition on the posterior mode of \\(\\tau\\) as it ignores the uncertainty associated with \\(\\tau\\) as conveyed by the full posterior distribution. in bayesian statistics, the posterior distribution encapsulates both the most likely values of parameters as well as the uncertainty or variability in those estimates. by only considering the mode (the peak or maximum) of the posterior distribution and neglecting its shape and spread, we may miss out on valuable information about the range of plausible values for Ï and the associated uncertainty. discussion table 5.3 summarizes the \\(200\\) simulated effect estimates for all eight schools. the bayesian probability that the effect in school a is as large as \\(28\\) points is less than \\(10\\%\\), which is substantially less than the \\(50\\%\\) probability based on the separate estimate for school a. as an illustration of the simulation-based posterior results, \\(200\\) simulations of school a's effect are shown in figure 5.8a. having simulated the parameter \\(\\theta\\), it is easy to ask more complicated questions of this model. for example, what is the posterior distribution of \\(\\max(\\theta_j)\\), the effect of the most successful of the eight coaching programs? figure 5.8b displays a histogram of \\(200\\) values from this posterior distribution and shows that only \\(22\\) draws are larger than

proportion of simulated draws of \\(\\theta\\) for which \\(\\theta_1 > \\theta_3\\); the result is \\(\\frac{141}{200} = 0.705\\). to sum up, the bayesian analysis of this example not only allows straightforward inferences about many parameters that may be of interest, but the hierarchical model is flexible enough to adapt to the data, thereby providing posterior inferences that account for the partial pooling as well as the uncertainty in the hyperparameters. $(\"pre\").each(function (index, item) { $(item).html(\"<code>\" + $(item).html() + \"</code>\"); }); hljs.highlightall(); "

    "body": " index search search back hierarchical normal modeling example: ratings of animation movies movielens is a website which provides personalized movie recommendations from users who create accounts and rate movies that they have seen. based on such information, movielens works to build a custom preference profile for each user and provide movie recommendations. a hierarchical normal model with random \\(\\sigma\\) in this situation it is reasonable to develop a model for the movie ratings where the grouping variable is the movie title. we index a rating by two subscripts, where \\(y_{ij}\\) denotes the \\(i\\)th rating for the \\(j\\)th movie title, with \\(j = 1, \\cdots, 8\\). since the ratings are continuous, it is reasonable to use the normal data model. for simplicity and ease of illustration, a common and shared unknown standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) is assumed for all normal models (however it could also be modeled). therefore we define the sampling distribution as: \\begin{align} y_{ij} | \\mu_j, \\sigma \\sim \\text{normal}(\\mu_j, \\sigma) \\end{align} since these movies are all animations, it is reasonable to believe that the mean ratings are similar across movies. so one assigns each mean rating the same normal prior distribution at the first stage: \\begin{align} \\mu_j | \\mu, \\tau \\sim \\text{normal}(\\mu, \\tau) \\end{align} the hyperparameters \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\tau\\) are treated as random since we are unsure about the degree of pooling of the eight sets of ratings. after observing data, inference is performed about \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\tau\\) based on their posterior distributions. treating \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\tau\\) as random, one arrives at the following hierarchical model: sampling for \\(j = 1, \\cdots, 8\\) and \\(i = 1, \\cdots, n_j\\): \\begin{align} y_{ij} | \\mu_j, \\sigma \\sim \\text{normal}(\\mu_j, \\sigma) \\end{align} prior for \\(\\mu_j\\), stage 1, \\(j = 1, \\cdots, 8\\): \\begin{align} \\mu_j | \\mu, \\tau \\sim \\text{normal}(\\mu, \\tau) \\end{align} prior for \\(\\mu_j\\), stage 2, the hyperprior: \\begin{align} \\mu, \\tau \\sim \\pi(\\mu, \\tau) \\end{align} to complete the model, one needs to specify a prior distribution for the standard deviation parameter, \\(\\sigma\\): \\begin{align} \\frac{1}{\\sigma^2} | a_{\\sigma}, b_{\\sigma} \\sim \\text{gamma}(a_{\\sigma}, b_{\\sigma}) \\end{align} one assigns a known gamma prior distribution for \\(\\frac{1}{\\sigma^2}\\), with fixed hyperparameter values \\(a_{\\sigma}\\) and \\(b_{\\sigma}\\). in some situations, one may consider the situation where \\(a_{\\sigma}\\) and \\(b_{\\sigma}\\) are random and assign hyperprior distributions for these unknown hyperparameters. it is helpful to contrast the two-stage prior distribution for \\(\\{\\mu_j\\}\\) and the one-stage prior distribution for \\(\\sigma\\). for the means \\(\\{\\mu_j\\}\\), we have discussed that specifying a common prior distribution for different \\(j\\) pools information across the movies. one is simultaneously estimating both a mean for each movie (the \\(\\mu_j\\)'s) and the variation among the movies (\\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\tau\\)). for the standard deviation, the hierarchical model also pools information across movies. however, all of the observations are combined in the estimation of \\(\\sigma\\). since separate values of \\(\\sigma_j\\), one cannot learn about the differences and similarities among the \\(\\sigma_j\\)'s. graphical representation of the hierarchical model an alternative way of expressing this hierarchical model uses the following graphical representation. in the middle section of the graph, \\(y_{ij}\\) represents the collection of random variables for all ratings of movie \\(j\\). the upper section of the graph focuses on the \\(\\mu_j\\)'s. all means follow the same prior, a normal distribution with mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\). since \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\tau\\) are random, these second-stage parameters are associated with the prior label \\(\\pi(\\mu, \\tau)\\). second-stage prior the hierarchical normal model presented in equations (10.6) through (10.9) has not specified the hyperprior distribution \\(\\pi(\\mu, \\tau)\\). how does one construct a prior on these second-stage hyperparameters? a typical approach for normal models is to assign two independent prior distributions â a normal distribution for the mean \\(\\mu\\) and a gamma distribution for the precision \\(\\frac{1}{\\tau^2}\\). such a specification facilitates the use of the gibbs sampling. using this approach, the density \\(\\pi(\\mu, \\tau)\\) is replaced by the two hyperprior distributions below: \\begin{align} \\mu | \\mu_0, \\gamma_0 \\sim \\text{normal}(\\mu_0, \\gamma_0) \\end{align} \\begin{align} \\frac{1}{\\tau^2} | a, b \\sim \\text{gamma}(a_{\\tau}, b_{\\tau}) \\end{align} the task of choosing a prior for \\((\\mu, \\tau)\\) reduces to the problem of choosing values for the four hyperparameters \\(\\mu_0, \\gamma_0, a_{\\tau}\\) and \\(b_{\\tau}\\). if one believes that \\(mu\\) is located around the value of \\(3\\) and she is not very confident of this choice, the set of values \\(\\mu_0 = 3\\) and \\(\\gamma_0 = 1\\) could be chosen. as for \\(\\tau\\), one chooses a weakly informative prior with \\(a_{\\tau} = b_{\\tau} = 1\\) as \\(\\text{gamma}(1, 1)\\). moreover, to choose a prior for \\(\\sigma\\), let \\(a_{\\sigma} = b_{\\sigma} = 1\\) to have the weakly informative \\(\\text{gamma}(1, 1)\\) prior. inference through mcmc with the specification of the prior, the complete hierarchical model is described as follows: sampling for \\(j = 1, \\cdots, 8\\) and \\(i = 1, \\cdots, n_j\\): \\begin{align} y_{ij} | \\mu_j, \\sigma \\sim \\text{normal}(\\mu_j, \\sigma) \\end{align} prior for \\(\\mu_j\\), stage 1, \\(j = 1, \\cdots, 8\\): \\begin{align} \\mu_j | \\mu, \\tau \\sim \\text{normal}(\\mu, \\tau) \\end{align} prior for \\(\\mu_j\\), stage 2: the hyperpriors: \\begin{align} \\mu \\sim \\text{normal}(3, 1) \\end{align} \\begin{align} \\frac{1}{\\tau^2} \\sim \\text{gamma}(1, 1) \\end{align} prior for \\(\\sigma\\) \\begin{align} \\frac{1}{\\sigma^2} \\sim \\text{gamma}(1, 1) \\end{align} describe the model by a script the first step in using the jags software is to write the following script defining the hierarchical model. the model is saved in the character string modelstring. modelstring <-\" model { ## sampling for (i in 1:n){ y[i] ~ dnorm(mu_j[movieindex[i]], invsigma2) } ## priors for (j in 1:j){ mu_j[j] ~ dnorm(mu, invtau2) } invsigma2 ~ dgamma(a_s, b_s) sigma <- sqrt(pow(invsigma2, -1)) ## hyperpriors mu ~ dnorm(mu0, g0) invtau2 ~ dgamma(a_t, b_t) tau <- sqrt(pow(invtau2, -1)) } \" in the sampling part of the script, note that the loop goes from 1 to n, where n is the number of observations with index i. however, because now n observations are grouped according to movies, indicated by j, one needs to create one vector, mu_j of length eight, and use movieindex[i] to grab the corresponding mu_j based on the movie index. in the priors part of the script, the loop goes from 1 to j, and j = 8 in the current example. inside the loop, the first line corresponds to the prior distribution for mu_j. due to a commonly shared sigma, invsigma2 follows dgamma(a_g, b_g) outside of the loop. in addition, sigma <- sqrt(pow(invsigma2, -1)) is added to help tracksigma directly. finally in the hyperpriors section of the script, one specifies the normal hyperprior for mu, a gamma hyperprior for invtau2. keep in mind that the arguments in the dnorm in jags are the mean and the precision (std). if one is interested instead in the standard deviation parameter tau, one could return it in the script by using tau <- sqrt(pow(invtau2, -1)), enabling the tracking of its mcmc chain in the posterior inferences. define the data and prior parameters after one has defined the model script, the next step is to provide the data and values for parameters of the prior. in the r script below, a list the_data contains the vector of observations, the vector of movie indices, the number of observations, and the number of movies. it also contains the normal hyperparameters mu0 and g0, and two sets of gamma hyperparameters (a_t and b_t) for invtau2, and (a_s and b_s) for invsigma2. y <- movieratings$rating movieindex <- movieratings$group_number n <- length(y) j <- length(unique(movieindex)) the_data <- list(\"y\" = y, \"movieindex\" = movieindex, \"n\" = n, \"j\" = j, \"mu0\" = 3, \"g0\" = 1, \"a_t\" = 1, \"b_t\" = 1, \"a_s\" = 1, \"b_s\" = 1) one uses the run.jags() function in the runjags r package to generate posterior samples by using the mcmc algorithms in jags. the script below runs one mcmc chain with \\(1000\\) iterations in the adapt period (preparing for mcmc), \\(5000\\) iterations of burn-in and an additional set of \\(5000\\) iterations to be run and collected for inference. by using monitor = c(\"mu\", \"tau\", \"mu_j\", \"sigma\"), one collects the values of all parameters in the model. in the end, the output variable posterior contains a matrix of simulated draws. posterior <- run.jags(modelstring, n.chains = 1, data = the_data, monitor = c(\"mu\", \"tau\", \"mu_j\", \"sigma\"), adapt = 1000, burnin = 5000, sample = 5000) mcmc diagnostics and summarization to perform some mcmc diagnostics in our example, one uses the plot() function, specifying the variable to be checked by the vars argument. for example, the script below returns four diagnostic plots (trace plot, empirical pdf, histogram, and autocorrelation plot) for the hyperparameter \\(\\tau\\). plot(posterior, vars = \"tau\") in practice mcmc diagnostics should be performed for all parameters to justify the overall mcmc convergence. in our example, the above diagnostics should be implemented for each of the eleven parameters in the model: \\(\\mu, \\tau, \\mu_1, \\cdots, \\mu_8\\) and \\(\\sigma\\). once diagnostics are done, one reports posterior summaries of the parameters using print(). note that these summaries are based on the 5000 iterations from the sample period, excluding the adapt and burn-in iterations. print(posterior, digits = 3) lower95 median upper95 mean sd mode mcerr mu 3.19 3.78 4.34

have the lowest average ratings with short \\(90\\%\\) credible intervals, \\((2.96, 3.99)\\) and \\((2.74, 4.27)\\) respectively, whereas \"legend of the guardians: the owls of gaâhoole\" (corresponding to \\(Î¼_6\\)) also has a low average rating but with a wider \\(90\\%\\) credible interval \\((2.70, 4.99)\\). the differences in the width of the credible intervals stem from the sample sizes: there are eleven ratings for \"how to train your dragon\", four ratings for \"megamind\", and only a single rating for \"legend of the guardians: the owls of gaâhoole\". the smaller the sample size, the larger the variability in the inference, even if one pools information across groups. shrinkage recall that the two-stage prior specifies a shared prior normal \\((\\mu, \\tau)\\) for all \\(\\mu_j\\)'s which facilitates simultaneous estimation of the movie mean ratings (the \\(\\mu_j\\)'s), and estimation of the variation among the movie mean ratings through the parameters \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\tau\\). the posterior mean of the rating for a particular movie \\(\\mu_j\\) shrinks the observed mean rating towards an average rating. the following figure displays a shrinkage plot which illustrates the movement of the observed sample mean ratings towards an average rating. the left side plots the sample movie rating means and lines connect the sample means to the corresponding posterior means (i.e. means of the posterior draws of \\(\\mu_j\\)). the shrinkage effect is obvious for the movie \"batman: under the red hood\" which corresponds to the dot at the value \\(5.0\\) on the left. this movie only received one rating of \\(5.0\\) and its mean rating \\(\\mu_5\\) shrinks to the value \\(4.178\\) on the right, which is still the highest posterior mean among the nine movie posterior means. a large shrinkage is desirable for a movie with a small number of ratings such as \"batman: under the red hood\". for a movie with a small sample size, information about other ratings of similar movies helps to produce a more reasonable estimate at the true average movie rating. the amount of shrinkage is more modest for movies with larger sample sizes. sources of variability we know that the prior distribution \\(\\text{normal}(\\mu, \\tau)\\) is shared among the means \\(\\mu_j\\)'s of all groups in a hierarchical normal model, and the hyperparameters \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\tau\\) provide information about the population of \\(\\mu_j\\)'s. specifically, the standard deviation \\(\\tau\\) measures the variability among the \\(\\mu_j\\)'s. when the hierarchical model is estimated through mcmc, summaries from the simulation draws from the posterior of \\(\\tau\\) provide information about this source of variation after analyzing the data. there are actually two sources for the variability among the observed \\(y_{ij}\\)'s: sampling level: within-group variability: \\begin{align} y_{ij} \\sim \\text{normal}(\\mu_j, \\sigma) \\end{align} group level between-group variability: \\begin{align} \\mu_{j} | \\mu, \\tau \\sim \\text{normal}(\\mu, \\tau) \\end{align} when the hierarchical model is fit through mcmc, summaries from the marginal posterior distributions of \\(\\sigma\\) and \\(\\tau\\) provide information about the two sources of variability. the bayesian posterior inference in the hierarchical model is able to compare these two sources of variability, taking into account the prior belief and the information from the data. one initially provides prior beliefs about the values of the standard deviations \\(\\sigma\\) and \\(\\tau\\) through gamma distributions. what can be said about these two sources of variability after the estimation of the hierarchical model? as seen in the output of print(posterior, digits = 3), the \\(90\\%\\) credible interval for \\(\\sigma\\) is \\((0.763, 1.12)\\) and the \\(90\\%\\) credible interval for \\(\\tau\\) is \\((0.357, 1.08)\\). after observing the data, the within-group variability in the measurements is estimated to be larger than the between-group variability. to compare both variability sources we compute: \\begin{align} r = \\frac{\\tau^2}{\\tau^2 + \\sigma^2} \\end{align} it represents the fraction of the total variability in the movie ratings due to the differences between groups. if the value of \\(r\\) is close to \\(1\\), most of the total variability is attributed to the between-group variability. on the other side, if \\(r\\) is close to \\(0\\), most of the variation is within groups and there is little significant differences between groups. a \\(95\\%\\) credible interval for \\(r\\) is \\((0.149, 0.630)\\). since much of the posterior probability of \\(r\\) is located below the value \\(0.5\\), this confirms that the variation between the mean movie rating titles is smaller than the variation of the ratings within the movie titles in this example. $(\"pre\").each(function (index, item) {

necessarily, lead to proper posterior distributions. calibration posterior inferences can be evaluated using the concept of calibration of the posterior mean. for any parameter \\(\\theta\\), if we label the posterior mean as \\(\\hat{\\theta} = \\mathbb{e}[\\theta|y]\\), we can define the miscalibration of the posterior mean as \\(\\mathbb{e}[\\theta|\\hat{\\theta}] - \\hat{\\theta}\\). we can judge the accuracy of our conclusions from bayesian analysis by checking how close the average value we predict (the posterior mean) is to the true value. here's how it works: if we call our predicted average value \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\), and we calculate how far off it is from the true value \\(\\theta\\), that's what we call the miscalibration of the prediction. if our initial guesses (prior distribution) are accurate and our data matches those guesses, then our predictions will be right on target, meaning the miscalibration will be zero. these are models where the probabilities don't add up to \\(1\\), which makes it impossible to draw a parameter \\(\\theta\\) from them. so, we need to expand our theory to deal with this. to see if our predictions are accurate in these cases, we need to imagine a \"true\" prior distribution where \\(\\theta\\) comes from, and compare it to the \"inferential\" prior distribution we actually use for our bayesian analysis. let's take the example of the 8 schools model. here, we consider an improper uniform distribution on \\(\\tau\\) (a parameter in the model) as a limit of uniform distributions on a range (from \\(0\\) to a really large number \\(a\\), which is getting bigger and bigger). when we use this improper uniform distribution, our inferences tend to overestimate \\(\\tau\\). let's see why: if both the \"true\" and \"inferential\" prior distributions are uniform on \\((0, a)\\), our miscalibration is zero. this means our predictions are accurate. now, if we keep the \"true\" prior distribution as \\(u(0, a)\\) but let the \"inferential\" prior distribution go to \\(u(0, \\infty)\\), our predictions tend to increase (because now we're including more and more extreme values of \\(\\theta\\)), which leads to a positive miscalibration. classes of noninformative and weakly informative prior distributions for hierarchical variance parameters general considerations we view any noninformative or weakly informative prior distribution as inherently provisionalâafter the model has been fit, one should look at the posterior distribution and see if it makes sense. if the posterior distribution does not make sense, this implies that additional prior knowledge is available that has not been included in the model, and that contradicts the assumptions of the prior distribution that has been used uniform prior distributions when we're setting up our model, we often start with uniform priors. but we have to be careful about how we define the scale of this uniform distribution. one common situation is when we're dealing with parameters that must be positive, like variance parameters. using a uniform prior on the logarithm of these parameters (\\(\\log \\tau\\)) might seem like a good idea, but it can lead to problems because the resulting posterior distribution becomes improper (doesn't add up to 1). an alternative is trying to set up a range for our prior distribution, like \\([-a, a]\\) where \\(a\\) is a really large number. this seems like a good idea to keep things in check, but there's a catch: the posterior distribution (our updated belief after looking at the data) can end up heavily influenced by the lower bound, \\(-a\\), of our range. when we calculate the marginal likelihood \\(p(y|\\tau)\\) of our data given a certain parameter (\\(\\tau\\)), it ends up approaching a fixed, non-zero value as \\(\\tau\\) gets really close to \\(0\\). because when we calculate the likelihood of our data given a parameter (\\(\\tau\\)), it's like asking, \"how likely is it that we'd see this data if our parameter Ï were true?\" now, imagine \\(\\tau\\) is getting really close to \\(0\\). in many situations, this means we're saying there's almost no variability in our data. but even if \\(\\tau\\) is very close to \\(0\\), the likelihood of observing our data isn't exactly \\(0\\). there's still some chance, even if it's tiny, that we'd see our data just by random chance, even with very little variability. so, as \\(\\tau\\) approaches \\(0\\), the likelihood doesn't drop to \\(0\\) as well. instead, it approaches a fixed, non-zero value. another option we can consider is using a uniform prior distribution directly on the parameter \\(\\tau\\) itself. this helps avoid some of the problems we discussed earlier because it keeps the total probability finite, especially near \\(\\tau = 0\\). however, there's a drawback to this approach. it tends to lean slightly towards positive values, because it allows for the possibility of very large values of \\(\\tau\\) as well. when we're dealing with just one or two groups (\\(j = 1\\) or \\(2\\)), using this uniform prior actually results in an improper posterior density. this means that our analysis essentially concludes that \\(\\tau\\) is infinite, and it doesn't do any pooling of data from different groups. in a way, this makes sense because it's hard to decide from just a few groups how much we should pool their data together. but from a bayesian perspective, it's a bit awkward because we're making this decision before even looking at the data. when we're dealing with these improper uniform prior distributions, we can think of them as being like the limit of certain types of weakly informative priors. for example, the uniform prior distribution on the logarithm of \\(\\tau\\) is basically like saying that \\(\\tau\\) follows a distribution where the probability decreases as \\(\\tau\\) gets bigger. sometimes, in bayesian statistics, people suggest using a uniform prior distribution directly on \\(\\tau^2\\). this means that every possible value for \\(\\tau^2\\) is considered equally likely. however, we don't recommend this approach. it tends to have a bigger issue with miscalibration towards higher values compared to the other approaches we discussed earlier. plus, using this uniform prior on Ï squared requires us to have at least 4 groups for the analysis to work properly and give us a reasonable posterior distribution. inverse-gamma\\((\\epsilon, \\epsilon)\\) prior distributions in the schools model, the parameter \\(\\tau\\) doesn't have any simple family of prior distributions that work well because its likelihood depends on all the data from all the groups in a complex way. however, there's a kind of distribution called the inverse-gamma family that works well in this situation. this means that if we use an inverse-gamma distribution as a prior for \\(\\tau^2\\), then after we collect our data and update our beliefs, the conditional distribution for \\(\\tau^2\\), \\(p(\\tau^2|\\mu, \\theta, y)\\) that we get is still an inverse-gamma distribution. the inverse-gamma prior distribution is a way to set up our beliefs in a noninformative (or weakly informative) manner when we're dealing with certain types of data. we choose a parameter called alpha (\\(\\alpha\\)) to control how informative the prior is. now, here's the thing: if we set alpha to a very low value, like \\(1\\) or \\(0.01\\) or \\(0.001\\), it's supposed to mean we're not putting much prior information into our model. but there's a problem: when we make alpha too small, the posterior distribution (our updated beliefs after looking at the data) can end up being improper, which means it doesn't add up to \\(1\\). to avoid this, we need to set alpha to a reasonable value, not too small. half-cauchy prior distributions we're going to look at another type of distribution called the \\(t\\) family, specifically the \\(\\text{half}-t\\) because our scale parameter (\\(\\tau\\)) has to be positive. now, we're interested in the \\(t\\) family for this problem because it's pretty flexible and can cover a wide range of situations. plus, we can use a neat trick called reparameterization to express it as a prior distribution for our scale parameter (\\(\\tau\\)) in a way that works well with our model. here's why it's helpful: the half-cauchy distribution has a wide peak around zero and just one parameter that we can adjust, which we'll call \\(a\\). we can set \\(a\\) to be a large value, and as it gets bigger and bigger (approaching infinity), the half-cauchy distribution starts to look more like a uniform distribution on our parameter \\(\\tau\\). when we set \\(a\\) to a large but finite value, it means we're using a slightly informative prior distribution. even though it's not completely flat, it's still pretty gentle, especially in the tails. this means that even if we have some prior beliefs, the data we collect can still have a big influence on our final results, especially if the data is strong. so, we're going to use the half-cauchy distribution for situations where we're estimating variance parameters from just a few groups. in these cases, our choices about our prior beliefs can really affect our results, so we want to use a prior distribution that's flexible and doesn't have a strong influence unless the data really supports it. application to the 8-schools example we demonstrate the properties of some proposed noninformative prior densities on the eight-schools example of section 5. figure 5.9 displays the posterior distributions for the 8-schools model resulting from three different choices of prior distributions that are intended to be noninformative. the first histogram (on the left) shows what we think about the parameter \\(\\tau\\) when we use a uniform prior distribution. the data suggest that \\(\\tau\\) could be anywhere below \\(20\\), but there's a small chance it could be even larger. this makes sense because we only have data from \\(8\\) groups, and it's hard to be sure about large values of \\(\\tau\\) with that little data. now, look at the second histogram (in the middle). here, we've changed our prior to something called an \\(\\text{inverse-gamma}(1, 1)\\) distribution. this changes our conclusions. now, our estimate for \\(\\tau\\) is lower, and we're more confident in our estimates for the individual group parameters (\\(\\theta_j\\)'s). to understand why this happens, let's think about the shape of our prior distribution. with the inverse-gamma prior, it's concentrated in a narrow range, from \\(0.5\\) to \\(5\\). this means it's not giving much weight to really large or really small values of \\(\\tau\\). in comparison, the uniform prior seemed less informative, meaning it didn't strongly influence our conclusions. the last histogram (on the right) in figure 5.9 shows what happens when we use a different kind of prior distribution called \\(\\text{inverse-gamma}(0.001, 0.001)\\) for \\(\\tau\\) squared. this prior is very sharply peaked near zero, meaning it puts a lot of emphasis on very small values of \\(\\tau\\). because of this, our conclusions from the data get distorted. even though the data might suggest that \\(\\tau\\) could be larger, the prior is pulling our estimates towards smaller values. the reason this happens is because the likelihood for \\(\\tau\\), stays high near zero. so even though our data might suggest that larger values of \\(\\tau\\) are possible, the strong influence of the prior near zero pulls our estimates towards smaller values. in this example, we're not considering two other options: using a uniform prior distribution on the logarithm of \\(\\tau\\), which would result in an improper posterior density with a spike at \\(\\tau = 0\\), similar to the last histogram but even more pronounced. using a uniform prior distribution directly on \\(\\tau^2\\), which would result in a posterior distribution similar to the first histogram, but with a slightly higher tail on the right side. application for the 3-schools problem the uniform prior distribution seems fine for the 8-school analysis, but problems arise if the number of groups \\(j\\) is much smaller, in which case the data supply little information about the group-level variance, and a noninformative prior distribution can lead to a posterior distribution that is improper or is proper but unrealistically broad. figure 5.10 displays the inferences for \\(\\tau\\) based on two different priors. we start with a default uniform distribution, which means we're not favoring any particular values for our parameter \\(\\tau\\). this worked well when we had data from \\(8\\) groups (as seen in figure 5.9). but now, we're looking at a new dataset with only \\(3\\) groups. unfortunately, the resulting histogram (the left one in figure 5.10) shows that the posterior distribution for \\(\\tau\\) has a really long tail on the right side. this means it's suggesting values of \\(\\tau\\) that are way too high to be reasonable. this long tail is expected because we have such a small number of groups (if we had even fewer groups, the tail would be even longer, going on forever). using this kind of posterior distribution can be a problem because it means we're not pooling the estimates of the school effects (\\(\\theta_j\\)) as much as we should be. the last histogram (on the right) in figure 5.10 shows what happens when we use a different kind of prior distribution called a half-cauchy. we set the scale parameter (\\(a\\)) of this prior to \\(25\\). we chose this value to be a bit higher than what we expect for the standard deviation of the underlying \\(\\theta_j\\)'s in our educational testing example. this way, our model only weakly constrains the parameter \\(\\tau\\). on the graph, you'll see a line that represents this prior distribution. it's highest for values of \\(\\tau\\) less than \\(50\\) and gradually falls off beyond that. this means the prior puts more weight on smaller values of \\(\\tau\\) but still allows for larger values. this half-cauchy prior distribution would also perform well in the 8-schools problem; however it was unnecessary because the default uniform prior gave reasonable results. with only 3 schools, we went to the trouble of using a weakly informative prior, a distribution that was not intended to represent our actual prior state of knowledge about \\(\\tau\\) but rather to constrain the posterior distribution, to an extent allowed by the data. $(\"pre\").each(function (index, item) { $(item).html(\"<code>\" + $(item).html() + \"</code>\"); }); hljs.highlightall(); "

    "body": " index search search back bayesian analysis of conjugate hierarchical models analytic derivation of conditional and marginal distributions hierarchical models involve multiple levels of parameters and dependencies between them, making the analysis more intricate. the following steps are necessary to disentangle the relationships between parameters at different levels of the hierarchy and to estimate their distributions accurately. joint posterior density: combines the prior information (hyperprior distribution \\(p(\\phi)\\)), the population distribution (\\(p(\\theta|\\phi)\\)), and the likelihood function \\(p(y|\\theta)\\) to form the joint posterior distribution. \\begin{align} p(\\theta, \\phi|y) \\propto p(y|\\theta)p(\\theta|\\phi)p(\\phi) \\end{align} conditional posterior density of the parameters: calculates the posterior distribution of \\(\\theta\\) given the hyperparameters \\(\\phi\\), allows us to understan how parameters interact and influence each other. this is usually done using a priori conjugate distributions. \\begin{align} p(\\theta|\\phi, y) \\end{align} hyperparameter estimation: estimating \\(\\phi\\) through the bayesian paradigm helps in updating our knowledge about the higher-level parameters based on the observed data. this step can be perfomed by integrating the joint posterior distribution over \\(\\theta\\) in to be able to marginalize \\(\\phi\\) conditionally on \\(y\\). \\begin{align} p(\\phi|y) = \\int p(\\theta, \\phi|y)d\\theta \\end{align} for many standard models the marginal posterior distribution of \\(\\phi\\) can be computed algebraically using the conditional probability formula: \\begin{align} p(\\phi|y) = \\frac{p(\\theta, \\phi|y)}{p(\\theta|\\phi, y)} \\end{align} drawing simulations from the posterior distribution the following strategy is useful for simulating a draw from the joint posterior distribution \\(p(\\theta, \\phi|y)\\) draw the vector of hyperparameters, \\(\\phi\\), from its marginal posterior distribution, \\(p(\\phi|y)\\). draw the parameter vector \\(\\theta\\) from its conditional posterior distribution, \\(p(\\theta|\\phi, y)\\). for the examples we consider in this chapter, the factorization \\(p(\\theta|\\phi, y) = \\prod_j p(\\theta_j|\\phi, y)\\) holds. if desired, draw predictive values \\(\\tilde{y}\\) from the posterior predictive distribution. the above steps are performed \\(l\\) times in order to obtain a set of \\(l\\) draws. from the joint posterior simulations of \\(\\theta\\) and \\(\\tilde{y}\\), we can compute the posterior distribution of any estimand or predictive quantity of interest. application to the model for rat tumors the data from experiments \\(j = 1, \\cdots, j\\), \\(j = 71\\), are assumed to follow independent binomial distributions: \\begin{align} y_j \\sim bin(n_j, \\theta_j) \\end{align} this models the probability of getting exactly \\(\\theta_j\\) successes in \\(n_j\\) independent bernoulli trials. with the number of rats \\(n_j\\) unknown. the parameters \\(\\theta_j\\) are assumed to be independent samples from a beta distribution: \\begin{align} \\theta_j \\sim beta(\\alpha, \\beta) \\end{align} and we shall assign a noninformative hyperprior distribution to reflect our ignorance about the unknown hyperparameters \\(\\alpha, \\beta\\). we defer the choice of noninformative hyperprior distribution, a relatively arbitrary and unimportant part of this particular analysis, until we inspect the integrability of the posterior density. joint, conditional, and marginal posterior distributions the joint posterior distribution of all the parameters is: \\begin{align} p(\\theta, \\alpha, \\beta|y) \\propto p(\\alpha, \\beta)p(\\theta|\\alpha,\\beta)p(y|\\theta, \\alpha, \\beta) \\end{align} where \\(p(\\alpha, \\beta)\\) is the hyperprior distribution (\\(p(\\phi)\\)). then \\(p(\\theta|\\alpha,\\beta)\\) is the population distribution (\\(p(\\theta|\\phi)\\)). the pdf of \\(x \\sim beta(\\alpha, \\beta)\\), ignoring the normalization constant, is given by: \\begin{align} p(\\theta|\\alpha, \\beta) \\propto \\frac{\\gamma(\\alpha + \\beta)}{\\gamma(\\alpha)\\gamma(\\beta)} x^{\\alpha - 1} (1- x)^{\\beta - 1} \\end{align} for \\(j = 1, \\cdots, j\\) i.i.d \\(\\theta_j \\sim beta(\\alpha, \\beta)\\): \\begin{align} p(\\theta|\\alpha, \\beta) \\propto \\prod_{j=1}^j \\theta_j^{\\alpha - 1} (1- \\theta_j)^{\\beta - 1} \\end{align} and \\(p(y|\\theta, \\alpha, \\beta)\\) is the likelihood (\\(p(y|\\theta)\\)). the pdf of \\(x \\sim bin(n, p)\\) is given by: \\begin{align} p(x = k|n, p) \\propto p^k (1 - p)^{n - k} \\end{align} for \\(j = 1, \\cdots, j\\) i.i.d \\(y_j \\sim bin(n_j, \\theta_j)\\): \\begin{align} p(y_j|n_j, \\theta_j) \\propto \\theta_j^{y_j} (1 - \\theta_j)^{n_j - y_j} \\end{align} therefore we obtain: \\begin{align} \\propto p(\\alpha, \\beta) \\left(\\prod_{j=1}^j \\frac{\\gamma(\\alpha +

conditional posterior density of \\(\\theta\\) given the hyperparameters is defined using a beta-binomial conjugate prior (page 7), therefore if: \\begin{align} y_i|n_j, \\theta_j \\sim bin(n_j, \\theta_j) \\end{align} \\begin{align} \\theta_j|\\alpha,\\beta \\sim beta(\\alpha, \\beta) \\end{align} then \\begin{align} \\theta_j|\\alpha, \\beta, y_j, n_j \\sim beta(\\alpha + y_j, \\beta + n_j

choosing a standard parameterization and setting up a 'noninformative' hyperprior distribution because we have no immediately available information about the distribution of tumor rates in populations of rats, we seek a relatively diffuse hyperprior distribution for \\((\\alpha, \\beta)\\). by reparameterizing the hyperparameters, we transform them into a space that may have more intuitive or meaningful interpretations. in this case, \\(logit(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha + \\beta}) = \\log(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta})\\) represents the log-odds of \\(\\alpha\\) relative to the total of \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\), providing a clear interpretation of the prior mean in the beta distribution for \\(\\theta\\). similarly, \\(\\log(\\alpha + \\beta)\\) captures the logarithm of the \"sample size,\" influencing the precision or spread of the distribution. also the logit transformation helps stabilize the numerical computations, especially when dealing with probabilities or proportions that are bounded between 0 and 1. by working in the logit space, we avoid issues related to extreme values or boundaries that can arise in the original parameter space. and transforming the hyperparameters can facilitate the specification of appropriate prior distributions. one reasonable choice of diffuse hyperprior density is uniform on \\((\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha + \\beta}, (\\alpha + \\beta)^{â1/2})\\), which when multiplied by the appropriate jacobian yields the following densities on the original scale, \\begin{align} p(\\alpha, \\beta) \\propto (\\alpha + \\beta)^{-5/2} \\end{align} and on the natural transformed scale: \\begin{align} p(\\log(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}), \\log(\\alpha + \\beta)) \\propto \\alpha\\beta(\\alpha + \\beta)^{-5/2} \\end{align} computing the marginal posterior density of the hyperparameters now that we have established a full probability model for data and parameters, we compute the marginal posterior distribution of the hyperparameters. the next figure shows a contour plot of the unnormalized marginal posterior density on a grid of values of \\((\\log(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}), \\log(\\alpha + \\beta))\\) to create the plot, we first compute the logarithm of the density function of \\(p(\\alpha, \\beta|y)\\) with prior density \\(p(\\alpha, \\beta) \\propto (\\alpha + \\beta)^{-5/2}\\), multiplying by the jacobian to obtain the density \\(p(\\log(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}), \\log(\\alpha + \\beta)|y)\\) the most obvious features of the contour plot are (1) the mode is not far from the point estimate (as we would expect), and (2) important parts of the marginal posterior distribution lie outside the range of the graph. we recompute the previous pdf in a different range \\((\\log(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}), \\log(\\alpha + \\beta)) \\in [-2.3, -1.3] \\times [1, 5]\\). figure \\(5.3b\\) displays \\(1000\\) random draws from the numerically computed posterior distribution. the graphs show that the marginal posterior distribution of the hyperparameters, under this transformation, is approximately symmetric about the mode, roughly \\((â1.75, 2.8)\\). this corresponds to approximate values of \\((\\alpha, \\beta) = (2.4, 14.0)\\), which differs somewhat from the crude estimate obtained earlier. having computed the relative posterior density at a grid that covers the effective range of \\((\\alpha, \\beta)\\), we normalize by approximating the distribution as a step function over the grid and setting the total probability in the grid to \\(1\\). sampling from the joint posterior distribution of parameters and hyperparameters we draw \\(1000\\) random samples from the joint posterior distribution of \\((\\alpha, \\beta, \\theta_1, \\cdots, \\theta_j)\\), as follows. simulate \\(1000\\) draws of \\((\\log(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}), \\log(\\alpha + \\beta))\\) from their posterior distribution using the same discrete-grid sampling procedure used to draw \\((\\alpha, \\beta)\\) for figure \\(3.3b\\). for \\(l = 1, \\cdots, 1000\\): transform the \\(l\\)th draw of \\((\\log(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}), \\log(\\alpha + \\beta))\\) to the scale \\((\\alpha, \\beta)\\) to yield a draw of the hyperparameters from their marginal posterior distribution. for each \\(j = 1, \\cdots, j\\), sample \\(\\theta_j\\) from its conditional posterior distribution, \\(\\theta_j|\\alpha, \\beta, y \\sim beta(\\alpha + y_j, \\beta + n_j â y_j)\\). displaying the results figure \\(5.4\\) shows posterior medians and \\(95\\%\\) intervals for the \\(\\theta_j\\)âs, computed by simulation. the results are superficially similar to what would be obtained based on a point estimate of the hyperparameters, which makes sense in this example, because of the fairly large number of experiments. but key differences remain, notably that posterior variability is higher in the full bayesian analysis, reflecting posterior uncertainty in the hyperparameters. $(\"pre\").each(function (index, item) { $(item).html(\"<code>\" + $(item).html() + \"</code>\"); }); hljs.highlightall(); "

    "body": " index search search back normal model with exchangeable parameters model definition we now present a full treatment of a simple hierarchical model based on the normal distribution, with different means for each \"group\" but with known observation variance and a normal population distribution for the group means. consider \\(j\\) independent experiments. the likelihood (sampling distribution) is defined as: \\begin{align} y_{ij} | \\theta_j \\sim \\text{n}(\\theta_j, \\sigma^2), \\text{ for } i = 1, \\cdots, n_j; j = 1, \\cdots, j. \\end{align} where we label the sample mean of each group \\(j\\) as: \\begin{align} \\overline{y}_j = \\frac{1}{n_j} \\sum_{i = 1}^{n_j} y_{ij} \\end{align} and the sampling variance as: \\begin{align} \\sigma^2_j = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n_j} \\end{align} here we assume that \\(\\sigma\\) is a know value. we can then write the likelihood for each \\(\\theta_j\\) using the sufficient statistics, \\(\\overline{y}_j\\): \\begin{align} \\overline{y}_j | \\theta_j \\sim \\text{n}(\\theta_j, \\sigma_j^2) \\end{align} sufficient statistics are summary statistics of the data that capture all the information about the parameter of interest. in this case, the sufficient statistic \\(\\overline{y}_j\\) represents the data summary for experiment \\(j\\) that is used to estimate the parameter \\(\\theta_j\\). by using the sufficient statistic \\(\\overline{y}_j\\), the likelihood function for each \\(\\theta_j\\) is constructed based on the observed data in experiment \\(j\\). the prior distribution over \\(\\theta_j\\), assuming the prior to be normal for the sake of conjugacy is defined as: \\begin{align} \\theta_j|\\mu, \\tau \\sim \\text{n}(\\theta_j|\\mu, \\tau^2) \\end{align} assuming each \\(\\theta_j\\) to be independent we obtain the following joint distribution: \\begin{align} p(\\theta_1, \\cdots, \\theta_j|\\mu, \\tau) = \\prod_{j=1}^j \\text{n}(\\theta_j|\\mu, \\tau^2) \\end{align} and by process of marginalization: \\begin{align} p(\\theta_1, \\cdots, \\theta_j) = \\int \\left[\\prod_{j=1}^j \\text{n}(\\theta_j|\\mu, \\tau^2)\\right]p(\\mu, \\tau) d(\\mu, \\tau) \\end{align} the hyperprior over the parameters \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\tau\\) is defined as a non-informative distribution (i.e. uniform density), such that: \\begin{align} p(\\mu, \\tau) = p(\\mu|\\tau)p(\\tau) \\propto p(\\tau) \\end{align} we define a prior distribution over \\(\\tau\\). for our illustrative analysis, we use the uniform prior distribution \\(p(\\tau) \\propto 1\\). once an initial analysis is performed using the noninformative 'uniform' prior density, a sensitivity analysis with a more realistic prior distribution is often desirable. inference joint posterior distribution this distribution combines prior information (hyperprior distribution \\(p(\\mu, \\tau)\\)) the population distribution \\(p(\\theta_j|\\mu, \\tau)\\) and the likelihood function \\(p(y_{ij}|\\theta_j)\\). we define it as follows: \\begin{align} p(\\theta, \\mu, \\tau|y) \\end{align} by bayes theorem (ignoring the normalization term): \\begin{align} \\propto p(y|\\theta) p(\\theta|\\mu, \\tau) p(\\mu, \\tau) \\end{align} here \\(p(y|\\theta)\\) is the likelihood function previously defined in terms of the sufficient statistics \\(\\overline{y}_j\\) \\begin{align} \\propto \\left[\\prod_{j=1}^j \\text{n}(\\overline{y}_j|\\theta_j, \\sigma_j^2)\\right] p(\\theta|\\mu, \\tau) p(\\mu, \\tau) \\end{align} and \\(p(\\theta|\\mu, \\tau)\\) is the prior, also previouly defined, such that: \\begin{align} \\propto \\left[\\prod_{j=1}^j \\text{n}(\\overline{y}_j|\\theta_j, \\sigma_j^2)\\right] \\left[\\prod_{j=1}^j \\text{n}(\\theta_j|\\mu, \\tau^2) p(y|\\theta)\\right] p(\\mu, \\tau) \\end{align} where we can ignore factors that depend only on \\(y\\) and the parameters \\(\\sigma_j\\), which are assumed known for this analysis. the conditional posterior distribution the conditional posterior distribution calculates the posterior distribution of \\(\\theta_j\\) given the hyperparameters \\(\\mu, \\tau\\). it allows us to understand how parameters intereact and influence each other. we define them for each \\(\\theta_j\\) as follows: \\begin{align} \\theta_j | \\mu, \\tau, y \\sim \\text{n}(\\hat{\\theta}_j, v_j) \\end{align} where: \\begin{align} \\hat{\\theta}_j = \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\sigma_j^2}\\overline{y}_j + \\frac{1}{\\tau^2}\\mu}{\\frac{1}{\\sigma_j^2} + \\frac{1}{\\tau^2}} \\end{align} and: \\begin{align} v_j = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{\\sigma_j^2} + \\frac{1}{\\tau^2}} \\end{align} the marginal posterior distribution this distribution allows us to estimate the hyperparameters \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\tau\\) through the bayesian paradigm. by the conditional rule we obtain: \\begin{align} p(\\mu, \\tau|y) \\propto p(\\mu, \\tau)p(y|\\mu, \\tau) \\end{align} where: \\begin{align} \\overline{y}_j | \\mu, \\tau \\sim \\text{n}(\\mu, \\sigma_j^2 + \\tau^2) \\end{align} such that: \\begin{align} p(\\mu, \\tau|y) \\propto p(\\mu, \\tau) \\prod_{j=1}^j \\text{n}(\\overline{y}_j|\\mu, \\sigma^2_j + \\tau^2) \\end{align} posterior distribution of \\(\\mu\\) given \\(\\tau\\) we can further simplify by integrating over \\(\\mu\\), leaving a simple univariate numerical computation of \\(p(\\tau|y)\\), by the conditional rule: \\begin{align} p(\\mu, \\tau|y) = p(\\mu | \\tau, y) p(\\tau|y) \\end{align} where: \\begin{align} \\mu | \\tau, y \\sim \\text{n}(\\hat{\\mu}, v_\\mu) \\end{align} with: \\begin{align} \\hat{\\mu} = \\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^j \\frac{1}{\\sigma_j^2 + \\tau^2}\\overline{y}_j}{\\sum_{j=1}^j \\frac{1}{\\sigma_j^2 + \\tau^2}} \\end{align} and \\begin{align} v_{\\mu}^{-1} = \\sum_{j=1}^j \\frac{1}{\\sigma_j^2 + \\tau^2} \\end{align} posterior distribution \\(\\tau\\) we know from the previous section that: \\begin{align} p(\\mu, \\tau|y) = p(\\mu | \\tau, y) p(\\tau|y) \\end{align} such that: \\begin{align} p(\\tau|y) = \\frac{p(\\mu, \\tau|y)}{p(\\mu | \\tau, y)} \\end{align} we previously defined \\(\\mu | \\tau, y \\sim \\text{n}(\\hat{\\mu}, v_\\mu)\\), therefore: \\begin{align} p(\\tau|y) = \\frac{p(\\mu, \\tau|y)}{\\text{n}(\\hat{\\mu}, v_\\mu)} \\end{align} we also defined \\(p(\\mu, \\tau|y) \\propto p(\\mu, \\tau) \\prod_{j=1}^j \\text{n}(\\overline{y}_j|\\mu, \\sigma^2_j + \\tau^2)\\): \\begin{align} \\propto \\frac{p(\\tau) \\prod_{j=1}^j \\text{n}(\\overline{y}_j|\\mu, \\sigma^2_j + \\tau^2)}{\\text{n}(\\hat{\\mu}, v_\\mu)} \\end{align} simulation for this model, computation of the posterior distribution of Î¸ is most conveniently performed via simulation, following the factorization: \\begin{align} p(\\theta, \\mu, \\tau|y) = p(\\theta|\\mu, \\tau, y) p(\\mu|\\tau, y) p(\\tau, y) \\end{align} posterior predictive distributions to obtain a draw from the posterior predictive distribution of new data \\(\\tilde{y}\\) from the current batch of parameters, \\(\\theta\\), first obtain a draw from \\(p(\\theta, \\mu, \\tau|y)\\) and then draw the predictive data \\(\\tilde{y}\\) from the sampling distribution: \\begin{align} y_{ij} | \\theta_j \\sim \\text{n}(\\theta_j, \\sigma^2), \\text{ for } i = 1, \\cdots, n_j; j = 1, \\cdots, j. \\end{align} to obtain posterior predictive simulations of

    "body": " index search search back hierarchical beta-binomial modeling example: deaths after heart attack the new york state (nys) department of health collects and releases data on mortality after a heart attack. we focus on 13 hospitals in manhattan, new york city, with the goal of learning about the percentages of resulted deaths from heart attack for hospitals in this sample. a hierarchical beta-binomial model treating âcasesâ as trials and âdeathsâ as successes, the binomial sampling model is a natural choice for this data, and the objective is to learn about the death probability \\(p\\) of the hospitals. if one creates thirteen separate binomial sampling models, one for each hospital, and conducts separate inferences, one loses the ability to use potential information about the death rate from hospital \\(i\\) when making inference about that of a different hospital \\(j\\). since these are all hospitals in manhattan, new york city, they may share attributes in common related to death rates from heart attack. therefore, one builds a hierarchical model based on a common beta distribution that generalizes the beta-binomial conjugate model described in chapter 7. let \\(y_i\\) denote the number of resulted deaths from heart attack, \\(n_i\\) the number of heart attack cases, and \\(p_i\\) the death rate for hospital \\(i\\). so the sampling and first stage of the prior of our model is written as follows: sampling for \\(i = 1, \\cdots, 13\\): \\begin{align} y_i \\sim \\text{binomial}(n_i, p_i) \\end{align} prior for \\(p_i\\), \\(i = 1, \\cdots, 13\\): \\begin{align} p_i \\sim \\text{beta}(a, b) \\end{align} note that the hyperparameters \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are shared among all hospitals. if \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are known values, then the posterior inference for \\(p_i\\) of hospital \\(i\\) is simply another beta distribution by conjugacy (refer to beta-binomial conjugate prior (page 7)): \\begin{align} p_i | y_i \\sim \\text{beta}(a + y_i, b + n_i - y_i) \\end{align} in the general situation where the hyperparameters \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are unknown, a second stage of the prior \\(\\pi(a, b)\\) needs to specified for these hyperparameters, such that the model is now defined as: sampling for \\(i = 1, \\cdots, 13\\): \\begin{align} y_i \\sim \\text{binomial}(n_i, p_i) \\end{align} prior for \\(p_i\\), stage 1: \\(i = 1, \\cdots, 13\\): \\begin{align} p_i \\sim \\text{beta}(a, b) \\end{align} prior for \\(p_i\\), stage 2: the hyperprior: \\begin{align} a, b \\sim \\pi(a, b) \\end{align} when we start analyzing the new york state heart attack death rate dataset, the specification of this hyperprior distribution \\(\\pi(a, b)\\) will be described. graphical representation one sees that the upper section of the graph represents the sampling density, with the arrow directing from \\(p_i\\) to \\(y_i\\). here the start of the arrow is the parameter and the end of the arrow is the random variable. the lower section of the graph represents the prior, with arrows directing from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) to \\(p_i\\). inference through mcmc second-stage prior for a \\(\\text{beta}(a, b)\\) prior distribution for a proportion \\(p\\), one considers the parameter \\(a\\) as the prior count of âsuccessesâ, the parameter \\(b\\) as the prior count of \"failures\", and the sum \\(a + b\\) represents the prior sample size. also the expectation is given by \\(\\frac{a}{a + b}\\). from these facts a more natural parametrization of the hyperprior distribution \\(\\pi(a, b)\\) is \\(\\pi(\\mu, \\eta)\\) where \\(\\mu = \\frac{a}{a + b}\\) is the hyperprior mean and \\(\\eta = a + b\\) is the hyperprior sample size. therefore: \\begin{align} \\mu, \\eta \\sim \\pi(\\mu, \\eta) \\end{align} where \\(a = \\mu\\eta\\) and \\(b = (1 - \\mu)\\eta\\). assume \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\eta\\) are independent which means that one's beliefs about the prior mean are independent of the beliefs about the prior sample size. the hyperprior expectation \\(\\mu\\) is the mean measure for \\(p_i\\), the average death rate across \\(13\\) hospitals. if one has little prior knowledge about the expectation \\(\\mu\\), one assigns this parameter a uniform prior which is equivalent to a \\(\\text{beta}(1, 1)\\) prior. to motivate the prior choice for the hyperparameter sample size \\(\\eta\\), consider the case where the hyperparameter values are known. if \\(y^*\\) and \\(n^*\\) are respectively the number of deaths and number of cases for one hospital, then the posterior mean of death rate parameter \\(p^*\\) is given by (refer to the beta-binomial conjugate definition): \\begin{align} \\mathbb{e}[p^*|y^*] = \\frac{y^* + \\mu\\eta}{n^* + \\eta} \\end{align} with a little algebra, the posterior mean is rewritten as \\begin{align} \\mathbb{e}[p^*|y^*] = (1 - \\lambda)\\frac{y^*}{n^*} + \\lambda\\mu \\end{align} where \\(\\lambda\\) is the shrinkage fraction: \\begin{align} \\lambda = \\frac{\\eta}{n^* + \\eta} \\end{align} the parameter \\(\\lambda\\) falls in the interval \\((0, 1)\\) and represents the degree of shrinkage of the posterior mean away from the sample proportion \\(\\frac{y^*}{n^*}\\) towards the prior mean \\(\\mu\\). suppose one believes a priori that, for a representative sample size \\(n^*\\), the shrinkage \\(\\lambda\\) is uniformly distributed on \\((0, 1)\\). by performing a transformation, this implies that the prior density for the prior sample size \\(\\eta\\) has the form: \\begin{align} \\pi(\\eta) = \\frac{n^*}{(n^* + \\eta)^2}, \\eta > 0 \\end{align} equivalently, the logarithm of \\(\\eta\\), \\(\\theta = \\log(\\eta)\\), has a logistic distribution with location \\(\\log(n^*)\\) and scale \\(1\\). we represent this distribution as \\(logistic(\\log(n^*), 1)\\), with pdf: \\begin{align} \\pi(\\theta) = \\frac{e^{-(\\theta - \\log(n^*))}}{(1 + e^{-(\\theta - \\log(n^*))})^2} \\end{align} with this specification of the hyperparameter distribution, one writes down the complete hierarchical model as follows: sampling for \\(i = 1, \\cdots, 13\\): \\begin{align} y_i \\sim \\text{binomial}(n_i, p_i) \\end{align} prior for \\(p_i\\), stage 1: \\(i = 1, \\cdots, 13\\): \\begin{align} p_i \\sim \\text{beta}(a, b) \\end{align} prior for \\(p_i\\), stage 2: the hyperpriors: \\begin{align} \\mu, \\eta \\sim \\pi(\\mu, \\eta) \\end{align} \\begin{align} \\log \\eta \\sim \\text{logistic}(\\log n^*, 1) \\end{align} where \\(a = \\mu\\eta\\) and \\(b = (1 - \\mu)\\eta\\) mcmc diagnostics and summarization after the diagnostics are performed, one reports posterior summaries of the parameters: from the posterior output, one evaluates the effect of information pooling in the hierarchical model. see figure 10.6 displays a shrinkage plot showing how the sample proportions are shrunk towards the overall death rate. to compare the posterior densities of the different \\(p_i\\), one displays the density estimates in a single graph as in the following figure: $(\"pre\").each(function (index, item) { $(item).html(\"<code>\" + $(item).html() + \"</code>\"); }); hljs.highlightall(); "

    "body": " index search search back introduccion while the idea of combining classifiers is not new, there is still a lot of scope for developing new combination approaches, types of features and classifiers used, and novel applications. fumera et al. presented a theoretical and experimental analysis of multiple classifiers with a focus on linear combiners. the authors particularly focused on simple and weighted averaging. their analysis showed that the performance of linear combiners depends on the accuracy of the individual classifiers and the correlation between their outputs. they also showed that the weighted averaging rule outperforms simple averaging. in weighted averaging, finding the optimal weights for each classifier is still an open problem. further research areas can involve the use of meta-heuristic optimization approaches such as the bat algorithm and other related techniques. in [8], polikar discussed the idea of combining classifiers' output labels in comparison with combination using classifiers' continuous outputs as well as their application to ensemble based systems. in combining continuous outputs, the degrees of support given to each class, by the different classifiers, are used by the combination technique. this support is referred to as score in some literatures. the classifiers output labels are mainly combined using majority voting or its variants. the author primarily reviewed conditions for which ensemble based systems outperform individual classifiers. different combination techniques were analyzed in details. in conclusion, the author stated that no single ensemble generation algorithm or combination rule is universally better than others. while there are several review papers in the literature, this paper presents a more updated survey including more recent approaches introduced during the past few years. since the last major review paper [10], several novel techniques have been introduced. these include a signal strength based combining approach [11], a novel bayes voting strategy [12], a modified weighted averaging technique using graph-theoretical clustering [13], a neural network based approach for training the combination rules [14], weighted features combination [15], and hierarchical fuzzy stack generalization [16], among others. bibliography classifiers combination techniques: a comprehensive review [10] s. chitroub, \"classifier combination and score level fusion: concepts and practical aspects,\" int. j. image data fusion, vol. 1, no. 2, pp. 113â135, jun. 2010.

    "body": " index search search back estrategias para la combinaciÃ³n de clasificadores this section provides a detailed review of classifiers combination techniques first, we discuss the different levels at which combination is performed: sensors, features and decisions. we then expand on the concept of soft vs. hard combination techniques. finally, we discuss how the combination techniques can be grouped as either adaptive or non-adaptive. levels of classifiers combination classifiers combination can be carried out at three different levels: early combination at sensor data level: combination of data collected from two or more sensors before feature selection technique is applied. combination at feature level: it may simply involve basic concatenation of feature vectors with equal or different weights (might result in high dimensonal vectors, whose dimension has to be reduced). late combination at the decision level: they are based on one of three approaches: abstract, rank, and score: abstract-based: a single output label from each individual classifier is used as input to the combination scheme. rank-based: each classifier yields several labels ranked from the most likely to the least likely. this information is then used by the combination scheme to reach the final decision. score-based: each classifier outputs the \\(n\\) best labels together with their confidence scores. the combination can be density-based, transformation-based or classifier-based score fusion. hard and soft level classifier combination another way to categorize combination algorithms is whether hard thresholding or soft scoring is used with each of the classifiers. hard-level combination: uses the output of the classifier after it is hard thresholded. soft-level combination: uses estimates of the aposteriori probability of the class. the sum, product, max, min rules, etc., fall under the soft level combiners as they use the output aposteriori probability of the classifier or a score. sum rule: the class with the highest sum of probabilities is chosen as the final prediction. product rule: the class with the highest product of probabilities is chosen as the final prediction. max rule: the class with the highest posterior probability among all classifications made by individual classifiers is selected as the final prediction. min rule: the class with the lowest posterior probability among all classifications made by individual classifiers is selected as the final prediction. majority voting is a typical example of hard-level combiners and has found widespread use in the literature. there are three different versions of voting: unanimous voting. more than half voting. highest number of votes. considering the output label vector of the \\(i\\)th classifier as: \\begin{align} [d_{i, 1}, \\cdots, d_{i, n}]^t \\in [0, 1]^n \\end{align} where \\(i = 1, 2, \\cdots, m\\) and \\(d_{i, j} = 1\\) if the classifier \\(d_i\\) labels the \\(i\\)th instance as class \\(\\omega_j\\) and \\(0\\) otherwise. the majority vote results in a decision for class \\(\\omega_k\\) if: \\begin{align} \\sum_{i = 1}^m d_{i, k} = \\max_{j = 1}^n \\sum_{i = 1}^m d_{i, j} \\end{align} where \\(m\\) is the total number of classifiers and \\(n\\) is total number of classes. such that class \\(\\omega_k\\) is the most \"selected\" on all the classifier. the accuracy of the combination scheme is given as: \\begin{align} p_{maj} = \\sum_{m = \\frac{m}{2} + 1}^m \\binom{m}{m} p^m (1-p)^{m - m} \\end{align} where \\(p\\) is the probability of correct classification. majority voting provides an accurate class label when at least \\(\\frac{m}{2} + 1\\) classifiers give correct classifications, it also requires participating classifiers to have comparable accuracies. weighted majority voting weighted majority voting is used when the classifiers' accuracies are not similar, so it is reasonable to assign more weight to the most accurate classifier. now the decision rule becomes: \\begin{align} \\sum_{i = 1}^m b_i d_{i, k} = \\max_{j = 1}^n \\sum_{i = 1}^m b_i d_{i, j} \\end{align} where \\(b_i\\) is the weight associated with classifier \\(d_i\\). for the sake of convenience, it is a good practice to normalize the weights such that the sum is one. the weight selection is very important in determining the overall accuracy of the classifier combinations. therefore, to minimize the classification error of the combination, the weights are assigned as follows: \\begin{align} b_i \\propto \\log\\left(\\frac{p_i}{1 - p_i}\\right) \\end{align} where \\(p_i, \\cdots, p_m\\) are the individual accuracies for each independent classifier. dynamic weighted consult-and-vote in [30], muhlbaier et al. introduced a method for combining ensembles of classifiers using a dynamic weighted consult-and-vote approach for incremental learning of new classes. the proposed technique focuses on incremental learning, specifically for incorporating new classes into the classification system. the consult-and-vote strategy involves a dynamic process where individual classifiers within the ensemble consult with each other to determine their respective voting weights for classifying test instances. the voting weights assigned to each classifier are determined based on their relative performance on the training data. the method proposed by muhlbaier et al. represents an enhancement over a previous approach developed by the authors. the previous approach may have encountered the \"out-voting\" problem, where certain classifiers dominate the decision-making process, potentially leading to biased or inaccurate results. divide and conquer another modification of majority voting, involving a divide and conquer strategy, is described in [31]. it aims to enhance the majority voting approach by breaking down the classification task into smaller, more manageable sub-problems. each sub-problem is then addressed independently, with dedicated classifiers or classification algorithms focusing on solving the specific challenges within that subset of data. after solving each of the smaller sub-problems individually, the results or decisions from these segments are combined using a majority voting scheme. majority voting involves aggregating the outputs of the classifiers or algorithms involved in solving the sub-problems and selecting the class label that receives the most votes as the final decision. quality based combination techniques the quality-based combination approach, as referenced in [32], focuses on assigning higher weights to more reliable classifiers based on specific quality measures. quality measures used to assess the performance of classifiers may vary depending on the application domain and specific requirements. feature combination the challenge of increasing dimensionality resulting from the simple combination of features from different datasets is addressed through innovative approaches to decision-level combination, as discussed in [33]. combining features from diverse datasets can lead to a significant increase in the dimensionality of the data. the study proposed an effective approach for decision-level combination by leveraging spectral reflectance and its higher-order derivatives to classify hyperspectral land images. spectral reflectance and its derivatives provide valuable information about the characteristics of the land surface, which can aid in classification tasks. the study conducted experiments under two scenarios to address the curse of dimensionality: scenario 1 - lda-based dimensionality reduction: linear discriminant analysis (lda) was employed for dimensionality reduction. scenario 2 - multiple classifiers decision fusion (mcdf): multiple classifiers were utilized for decision fusion to enhance classification performance. critic classifier in the study referenced as [34], the authors introduced an innovative approach that focuses specifically on addressing two-class classification problems. the key feature of this approach is the incorporation of a classifier critic associated with each individual classifier, aimed at predicting the error rate of the classifier. the role of the classifier critic is to forecast the potential error or misclassification rate of its associated classifier. the approach relies on classical standard voting techniques for combining the outputs of multiple classifiers. adaptative voting technique in the study referenced as [35], the authors introduced an adaptive approach to voting techniques. the key innovation in this approach is the dynamic weighting of classifiers based on their estimated recognition performance. different model combination in [36], the authors explored the combination of three distinct classifiers - naive bayes, j48 decision tree, and decision table - using various voting techniques to enhance classification accuracy. the classifiers were combined using different voting strategies, including simple voting (where each classifier has equal weight), weighted voting (assigning different weights to classifiers based on their performance), and probability-based voting (considering the confidence or probability estimates of classifiers). the study reported that the ensemble of classifiers using weighted and probability-based voting techniques outperformed simple majority voting. in addition to classifier combination and voting strategies, the study applied a supervised dimensionality reduction algorithm to further enhance performance. dimensionality reduction techniques aim to reduce the complexity of the feature space while preserving relevant information, thereby improving classification accuracy and efficiency. in [38], a voting strategy was employed for land cover classification of remotely sensed images by utilizing an ensemble of six different classifiers. common voting techniques include simple majority voting, weighted voting, or probability-based voting, where the combined decision is based on the collective predictions of the ensemble members. in the study referenced as [39], researchers proposed an approach that combines artificial neural network (ann) and k-nearest neighbors (knn) based classifiers using a majority voting scheme. this method was specifically designed to enhance accuracy in scenarios where sensor data is prone to drift. the researchers employed a majority voting scheme to combine the predictions of the ann and knn classifiers. in this approach, each classifier in the ensemble provides a prediction, and the final decision is made based on the majority vote of the individual classifier outputs. the primary goal of the study was to leverage the complementary strengths of ann and knn classifiers to address the challenge of sensor data drift. ann models are known for their ability to learn complex patterns from data, while knn is a non-parametric method based on instance-based learning that can be effective in classification tasks. by combining multiple knn classifiers using majority voting and employing median voting for the ann classifiers, the researchers observed a substantial improvement in classification performance. the ensemble of ann and knn classifiers demonstrated enhanced accuracy in classifying sensor data, showcasing the effectiveness of the majority voting scheme in mitigating the impact of data drift on classification outcomes. dynamic entropy based combination technique in [37], the authors introduced a novel dynamic entropy-based technique for combining classifiers. the key idea behind the combination scheme is to assign weights to individual classifiers based on their confidence levels in making decisions. classifiers that exhibit high confidence in their predictions are assigned larger weights, while those with lower confidence receive smaller weights. assuming linear dependency between predictors in [40], the authors considered linear dependency of both classifiers and features. to address this, they proposed a new approach that models the dependencies between features without making any assumptions about the distribution of features (independency) or classifiers. the researchers introduced two key models as part of their framework: linear classifier dependency modelling (lcdm): this model focuses on capturing dependencies between the classifiers themselves, exploring how the outputs of different classifiers may be linearly related. linear feature dependency modelling (lfdm) : this model is designed to identify and model dependencies between the features used by the classifiers, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the relationships within the feature space. the results of the study demonstrated that the proposed approach outperformed existing methods in scenarios where linear dependencies between features and classifiers play a significant role. by explicitly modeling these dependencies, the framework was able to capture more complex relationships within the data and improve classification accuracy. runtime weighted opinion pool in [45], introduces a novel classifiers combination approach known as the runtime weighted opinion pool (rwop). this approach dynamically assigns weights to the classifiers during runtime based on their local performance, leading to an adaptive and context-aware combination strategy. unlike traditional weighted sum-based approaches, rwop utilizes an intuitive runtime strategy to determine the weights for combining classifier outputs. the dynamic weight assignment in rwop allows the system to adapt to changing conditions and varying input patterns, leading to more robust and accurate classification outcomes. using hidden markov models in the study referenced as [46], the authors introduce a novel approach for combining classifiers specifically designed for hidden markov model (hmm) based classifiers. unlike traditional methods where the combination typically occurs at the decision level, this new approach operates at a more elementary level within the hmm framework. assigning weights to classes in the study referenced as [12], a novel weighted majority voting approach was proposed for classifiers combination. this approach differs from traditional methods by assigning weights to different classes rather than individual base classifiers. the weights are determined by estimating the joint probability distribution of each class using the scores provided by all classifiers in the combination pool. the joint probability distribution is computed using the naÃ¯ve bayes probabilistic model. combination rules in the context of multiple classifiers combination, the way individual classifiers handle input patterns can vary. some classifiers may use the same representation of the input pattern, while others may employ their own unique representations. the effectiveness of combining these classifiers using different strategies has been explored in various studies, including those referenced as [41], [42], and [43]. simple sum rule: despite being developed under restrictive assumptions, the simple sum rule was found to outperform other combination rules in certain scenarios. majority voting: the experimental results indicated that the majority voting approach was the most effective combination rule for the specific dataset used in the study. assesment fixed rule-based combination techniques in the context of multiple classifiers do not require a training stage and rely on class labels, distances, or confidences provided by individual classifiers. the efficiency of fixed rule techniques is influenced by various factors, as discussed in reference [44]. according to reference [44], fixed rule techniques are most efficient under specific conditions: availability of large training sets: adequate training data is essential for reliable performance. generation of reliable confidences: individual classifiers should provide accurate and trustworthy confidence values. training on different feature spaces: base classifiers should be trained on diverse feature representations to capture varied aspects of the data. in scenarios where the strict conditions for fixed rule techniques are not met, a trained combination rule may yield better results. adaptative and non-adaptative combiners adaptative combiners adaptive techniques for classifiers combination are mainly based on evolution or artificial intelligence algorithms. they include neural networks combination strategies and genetic algorithms as well as fuzzy set theory. techniques under these categories are summarized on the following figure: artificial neural networks are usually used as a base classifier [29], however, it has also found wide use in combination of classifiers. ad and cm combination in [48], the author introduces two innovative approaches for combining classifiers to enhance robustness and fault tolerance: the attractor dynamics (ad) algorithm and the classifier masking (cm) algorithm. the cm algorithm is described as a non-neural version of the ad algorithm, inspired by modeling properties of sensory integration in the central nervous system. both approaches are designed to promote consensus among individual classifiers and improve the overall performance of the combined system by discarding corrupted classifier outputs. ann vs svm combination in [49], the authors conducted a comparative analysis of combining the outputs of an ensemble of artificial neural networks (anns) with support vector machine (svm) classifiers for processing remotely sensed data. they employed an multi-layer perceptron (mlp) module to facilitate the non-linear combination of the outputs generated by the networks. the researchers explored two distinct approaches for optimizing coefficient selection: the bayesian method and the error correlation matrix. through experimental evaluation, the authors found that the mlp-based combination scheme yielded the most favorable results compared to the svm classifiers. combination through ann in [50], the authors proposed a novel approach where they utilized an artificial neural network (ann) as a model for combining classifiers. instead of combining the outputs of different classifiers, they integrated various training sets with distinct classifiers to train a unified combination rule within a three-layer ann architecture. in this setup, each classifier represented a unit in the hidden layer of the ann. incorporating a priori knowledge in [51], the authors delved into the significance of leveraging a priori knowledge within existing classifiers combination techniques, specifically exploring the application of the behavior knowledge space and the dempster-shafer (d-s) theory. this investigation aimed to elucidate how incorporating prior knowledge can enhance the performance of classifiers combination, particularly when dealing with strongly correlated classifiers. the study also highlighted the utilization of adaptive combiners, encompassing strategies such as adaptive weighting, associative switching, mixture of local experts (mle), and hierarchical mle combining combination strategies dynamically in [57] an adaptive approach to combining classifiers was introduced. the proposed approach dynamically selects between two different combination strategies based on the belief values obtained from each strategy. specifically, the study compared the performance of a bayesian classifiers combination approach and product and max rule combination strategy. in the bayesian method, the combination of classifiers is based on probabilistic principles, where the posterior probabilities of class labels are calculated using bayes' theorem. the product rule combines the outputs of individual classifiers by multiplying their probabilities or scores for each class. the max rule operates by selecting the class label that receives the highest score or confidence level among all the individual classifiers in the ensemble. modifying majority voting in [58] the authors introduced various modifications to the traditional majority voting rule by incorporating a bayesian framework and a genetic algorithm (ga) to determine the weights assigned to different classifiers in the ensemble. the bayesian framework allowed for the probabilistic modeling of the weights, while the ga provided an optimization technique to search for the best combination of weights that maximized the ensemble performance. the results of the study indicated that the modified majority voting rule, when combined with the bayesian framework and ga for weight optimization, achieved significant improvements in accuracy. specifically, the optimal accuracies obtained were \\(94.3\\%\\) for the majority vote, \\(95.4\\%\\) for the genetic algorithm, and 95.95% for the bayesian approach. based on genetic theory in the study referenced as [22], the authors introduced an innovative approach that involved the simultaneous extraction and selection of features and classifiers to improve the performance of gender and age classification using speech signals collected from a typical korean home environment. the authors employed a genetic algorithm to simultaneously select features and classifiers. ga is a metaheuristic optimization technique inspired by the process of natural selection and genetics, used to search for the optimal combination of features and classifiers for the classification task. the outputs of the selected classifiers were combined using the dempster-shafer theory, a mathematical theory for combining evidence from different sources to make decisions under uncertainty. in [59] a novel approach based on genetic algorithm (ga) with self-configuration capabilities was developed for classifier combination. the researchers employed a pool of twelve expert classifiers that were already trained on the task of character recognition, including both printed and handwritten characters. these expert classifiers likely had different strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable candidates for ensemble learning. the ga was integrated into the system to optimize the combination of outputs from the expert classifiers. by using the evolutionary principles of genetic algorithms, the system could iteratively adjust the weights assigned to each classifier in the ensemble to maximize the overall accuracy of the system. fuzzy based in the study referenced as [16], the authors introduced a novel approach known as fuzzy stacked generalization (fsg) to combine the outputs of multiple classifiers. fsg operates within a hierarchical framework where multiple base-layer classifiers are utilized to make individual predictions on the input data. in fsg, the decisions made by the base-layer classifiers are aggregated to form a decision vector. this decision vector is then fed into a meta-layer classifier, which combines the outputs of the base-layer classifiers to make the final decision. in [53], the authors proposed a classifiers combination technique using fuzzy templates (ft). an object is labeled with the class whose fuzzy template is closest to the objects' decision profile. the authors obtained an improved performance over majority, min, max and product rules, and unweighted average combination techniques in [54], an adaptive fuzzy integral was used to combine multiple classifiers. the parameter \\(\\lambda\\)-fuzzy, which measures performance, is adaptively adjusted depending upon the interaction among the classifiers. the essence of the parameter is to search for the maximum degree of agreement between the conflicting and complementary sources of evidence. in [55], a fuzzy decision rule was employed to combine the outputs of multiple classifiers without the need for a training stage. each classifier was independently applied to the input data, but no final decision was made based on their outputs at this stage. these classifiers are pre-existing models that have been trained on labeled data to make predictions or classifications. the results from the classifiers were aggregated using a fuzzy decision rule. this rule considered the membership degrees of the classes assigned by each classifier and selected the class with the highest membership degree (the confidence or certainty with which each classifier assigns a data point to a specific class) as the correct class. two measures of accuracy, namely information reliability and global accuracy, were utilized in the combination rule to assess the performance of the combined classifiers. in [56] the authors introduced a first-order takagi-sugeno-kang (tsk) fuzzy model for combining multiple classifiers. unlike conventional linear combination methods that assign different weights to pairs of classifiers and classes, the proposed tsk fuzzy model assigns weights to each individual classifier, class, and region of the classifier output space (decision boundary). this finer granularity in weight assignment allows for a more nuanced and adaptive combination of classifier outputs. the tsk fuzzy model is utilized to integrate the outputs of multiple classifiers. this model leverages fuzzy logic to combine the predictions of individual classifiers in a way that considers the uncertainty and variability in the classifier outputs. the study demonstrated improved accuracy compared to using individual classifiers alone. while the tsk fuzzy model showed promising results in enhancing classification accuracy, the authors did not explicitly address the potential bias and variance reduction that could arise from using a linear model for combining classifiers. non-adaptative combiners the highest confidence approach is an example of nonadaptive combination techniques. it involves ranking the individual classifiers based on their confidence then selecting the decision of the top ranked one. the borda count technique is also an example of nonadaptive methods. it is based on the principle of single winner classifier in which the individual classifiers provide a ranked list of the classes. it is a more sophisticated alternative to majority voting [60] based on ranking level [9]. it does not require training, just like averaging, sum, and voting rules [52]. conclusion in summary, adaptive combiners tend to do better than the non-adaptive types. this is due to the fact that adaptive combiners update the weights given to the individual classifier dynamically before making the final decision. given the fact that the performance of the individual classifiers can vary over input patterns, such a dynamic combination provides an edge over its non-adaptive counterpart especially when the data space is wide and diverse. classification based on the number of classifiers the most commonly used techniques for ensemble based combinations are displayed in the following figure: bagging is one of the most intuitive and simple techniques used for ensemble based combination. however, unlike bagging, in boosting, the individual classifiers are trained hierarchically to discriminate more complex regions in the feature space. adaboost is a variation of the boosting technique. it is an adaptive boosting meta-algorithm that combines outputs of weak classifiers into a weighted sum that represents the final decision. however, the technique is sensitive to noisy data and outliers. in [66], the authors used adaboost to enhance the performance of a hybrid hidden markov model (hmm) and neural network (nn) speech recognition system. hmms are commonly used for modeling sequential data like speech signals, while nns are effective in capturing complex patterns in data. the researchers evaluated the performance of the hybrid hmm/nn system with and without the adaboost algorithm under noisy environments. noise in speech signals can introduce distortions and affect the accuracy of the recognition system. by applying adaboost, the system was expected to adapt better to noisy conditions and enhance its robustness. the results of the study demonstrated that incorporating adaboost into the hybrid hmm/nn speech recognition system led to improved performance, even in the presence of noise. adaboost's ability to focus on difficult instances and adjust the weights of the classifiers based on their performance contributed to the system's ability to handle noisy environments and enhance overall recognition accuracy. in [67] the researchers explored a combination approach at the feature level using support vector machine (svm) classifiers and a global adaboost classifier. the study focused on combining features extracted from different datasets at the feature level. by utilizing svm classifiers and a global adaboost classifier, the researchers aimed to leverage the strengths of both classifiers in integrating information from multiple datasets to improve classification performance. one significant drawback identified in the study regarding feature-level combination is the issue of high dimensionality. combining features from multiple datasets can result in a large number of features, which can lead to challenges such as increased computational complexity, overfitting, and reduced interpretability of the model. other combination techniques in [68] the researchers introduced a novel classifiers combination technique based on an svm active learning algorithm. the study proposed a method that leverages support vector machine (svm) classifiers in conjunction with an active learning algorithm. active learning refers to a machine learning approach where the algorithm can select the most informative data points for labeling, thereby improving the learning process iteratively. the researchers developed a strategy where an initial classifier, likely an svm model, is used to generate class aposteriori probabilities. these probabilities serve as inputs to the classifiers-combiner, which is based on the svm active learning algorithm. the approach outperforms traditional classifiers combination rules when considering class labeling cost and classification accuracy. in [70] and [71] the researchers introduced a novel approach using eigenclassifiers for combining correlated classifiers. the proposed method involves utilizing principal component analysis (pca) projection to create eigenclassifiers from a set of initially correlated classifiers. by applying pca, the goal is to transform the correlated classifiers into uncorrelated eigen-classifiers. this transformation process aims to enhance the diversity and independence of the classifiers, enabling them to complement each other effectively during the combination stage. the results of the study indicated that the pca-based eigenclassifiers technique provided better or comparable accuracy with a reduced number of classifiers compared to bagging and adaboost. this suggests that the uncorrelation process facilitated by pca enhanced the performance of the combined classifiers, leading to improved classification results with fewer individual classifiers. similarly, in [72] the researchers explored methods to address linear and non-linear correlations among the outputs of individual classifiers by leveraging principal component analysis (pca) and a generalized kernel-based pca approach. initially, the authors identified linear correlations among the outputs of individual classifiers. to mitigate these linear correlations, the researchers applied a simple pca approach. building on the success of addressing linear correlations, the authors extended their approach to consider non-linear dependencies among the outputs of individual classifiers. o handle these non-linear dependencies, the researchers proposed a generalized kernel-based pca approach. the results of the experiments demonstrated that the generalized kernel-based pca approach outperformed alternative methods in improving classification accuracy. in [73] the researchers introduced a novel classifier combination technique that focused on extracting class boundaries and utilizing a set of local linear combination rules. the proposed technique involved extracting class boundaries, which are the decision boundaries that separate different classes in the dataset. the researchers employed a set of local linear combination rules to combine the outputs of individual classifiers. these rules likely involved linear combinations of classifier outputs within specific regions of the feature space, allowing for adaptive and context-aware decision-making. the experimental results demonstrated that the classifier combination technique based on class boundaries and local linear combination rules achieved better accuracy compared to other methods such as linear combination, voting, and decision templates. in [13], the researchers proposed a weighted averaging approach that incorporated graph-theoretical clustering and a support vector machine (svm) classifier for classifier combination. the researchers utilized graph-theoretical clustering techniques as part of the weighted averaging approach. graph theory provides a framework for analyzing relationships between data points, and clustering algorithms can group similar data points together based on certain criteria. by incorporating graph-theoretical clustering, the approach likely aimed to identify clusters of data points with similar characteristics for more effective combination of classifier outputs. in addition to clustering, the approach involved the use of an svm classifier. svms are powerful machine learning models commonly used for classification tasks. by integrating an svm classifier into the weighted averaging process, the researchers likely leveraged its ability to create optimal decision boundaries between classes in the feature space. the results obtained from the experiments indicated that the proposed approach, despite its simplicity and intuitive nature, performed comparably to more sophisticated methods. in [74], the researchers employed three different techniques - highest rank (hr), borda count (bc), and logistic regression (lr) - for combining decisions in a multi-classifier system. the decisions produced by each individual classifier were ranked based on their confidence or accuracy. the hr, bc, and lr techniques were then applied to either reduce the set of possible classes or re-rank them during the combination process. the results obtained from the experiments demonstrated a substantial improvement in the performance of the multi-classifier system. similarly, in [75] a new combination technique called mixed group rank (mgr) was introduced as a novel approach to balancing between preference and confidence in a multi-classifier system. this technique aimed to generalize the principles of highest rank (hr), borda count (bc), and logistic regression (lr) by incorporating elements of both preference-based ranking and confidence-based decision-making. in [76], the authors introduced an innovative approach that involves dynamically switching between classifier combination and classifier selection based on the characteristics of different regions in the feature space. the authors further introduced a hybrid combination scheme that integrates clustering-and-selection (cs) techniques with decision template (dt) methods. this hybrid approach likely combines the benefits of clustering for identifying regions of dominance and selection of the most appropriate classifier, along with decision templates for combining classifier outputs in a structured manner. the authors discussed the tradeoff between selecting the best classifier and combining classifiers. this tradeoff likely involves considerations of the strengths and weaknesses of individual classifiers versus the potential benefits of combining multiple classifiers. in [77], the authors introduced a method based on classifier selection that focused on identifying the most suitable candidate through confidence evaluation of distance-based classifiers. the method aimed to select the most precise candidate from a set of distance-based classifiers by evaluating their confidence levels. this process likely involved assessing the certainty or reliability of each classifier's decision-making based on the distances between data points in the feature space. the authors likely defined specific rules or criteria for selecting the precise candidate based on the confidence evaluations of the distance-based classifiers. these rules may have considered factors such as the proximity of data points to decision boundaries, the consistency of classifier outputs, or the overall confidence levels of individual classifiers. the experiments conducted in the study likely utilized distance metrics such as euclidean distance and city block distance for recognizing handwritten characters. in [78], the author used information from the confusion matrix to merge multiple classifiers using a class ranking borda type reconciliation method. the class ranking borda type reconciliation method is a technique that combines the outputs of multiple classifiers by ranking the classes based on their performance and then using a borda count approach to reconcile the rankings. the results obtained from this method were compared with three other classifier combination techniques: majority voting, sum rule, and median rule. the comparison was done using three types of confusion matrices: deterministic, uniform, and stochastic. the apborda (aposteriori borda count) and sum rule gave the overall best improvement, except in the case of a stochastic confusion matrix and disparate combination (where classifiers had a \\(10\\%\\) accuracy difference from each other). this means that in most cases, the apborda and sum rule performed better in combining the classifiers, but there were specific scenarios where they did not perform as well. in [79] a combination technique based on the f-measure was proposed for recognizing human emotions using an svm (support vector machine) classifier. in this technique, the f-measure was used to form a decision matrix to determine the final emotion. in [80], the authors proposed an approach for detecting vacant parking spaces by combining two different systems. the first system was based on analyzing image data, while the second system relied on sensor data. the experiments conducted by the authors demonstrated that combining the outputs of these two different systems resulted in a reduced error in detecting vacant parking spaces. in summary, several classifiers combination techniques have been proposed in the literature with each technique having its own strengths and weaknesses. recent techniques mostly involve hybridization or modification of previous techniques to achieve better accuracy or to remove an associated constraint on which a particular technique was built on. some of these constraints include the issue of correlated classifiers, gaussian distribution, and iid. there is still a need to develop classifiers combination strategies which are not constrained to specific distributions. references [12] c. de stefano, f. fontanella, and a. s. di freca, \"a novel naive bayes

    "title": "Evaluation Metrics",
    "body": " index search search back evaluation metrics formal limitations of clustering jon kleinberg proposes three axioms that highlight the characteristics that a grouping problem should exhibit and can be considered \"good\". scale invariance: indicates that a clustering algorithm should not modify its results when all distances between points are scaled by the factor determined by a constant \\(\\alpha\\). richness: the clustering function must be flexible enough to produce any arbitrary partition/clustering of the input data set. consistency: the clustering results do not change if the distances within clusters decrease and/or the distances between clusters increase. given the above three axioms, kleinberg proves the following theorem: for every \\(n \\geq 2\\), there is no clustering function \\(f\\) that satisfies scale invariance, richness, and consistency. since the three axioms cannot hold simultaneously, clustering algorithms can be designed to violate one of the axioms while sarisfying the other two. \\(k\\)-cluster stopping condition: stop merging clusters when we have \\(k\\) clusters (violates the richness axiom). distance \\(r\\) stopping condition: stop merging clusters when the nearest pair of clusters are farther than \\(r \\) (violates scale invariance). scale-\\(\\epsilon\\) stopping condition: stop merging clusters when the nearest pair of clusters are farther than a fraction \\(\\epsilon\\) the maximum pairwise distance \\(\\delta\\). (consistency is violated). methods for clustering evaluation when analyzing clustering results, several aspects must be taken into account for the validation of the algorithm results: determining the clustering tendency in the data (i.e. whether non-random structure really exists). determining the correct number of clusters. assessing the quality of the clustering results without external information. comparing the results obtained with external information. comparing two sets of clusters to determine which one is better. the first three issues are addressed by internal or unsupervised validation, because there is no use of external information. the fourth issue is resolved by external or supervised validation. finally, the last issue can be addressed by both supervised and unsupervised validation techniques. null hypothesis testing one of the desirable characteristics of a clustering process is to show whether data exhibits some tendency to form actual clusters. in this case, the null hypothesis \\(h_0\\) is the randomness of data and, when the null hypothesis is rejected, we assume that the data is significantly unlikely to be random. one of the difficulties of null hypothesis testing in this context is determining the statistical distribution under which the randomness hypothesis can be rejected. jain and dubes propose three alternatives: random plot hypothesis \\(h_0\\): all proximity matrices of order \\(n \\times n\\) are equally likely. random label hypothesis \\(h_0\\): all permutations of labels of \\(n\\) objects are equally likely. randon position hypothesis \\(h_0\\): all sets of \\(n\\) locations is some region of a \\(d\\)-dimensional space are equally likely. internal validation internal validation methods (or internal indices) make it possible to establish the quality of the clustering structure without having access to external information. in general, two types of internal validation metrics can be combined: cohesion measures: evaluates how closely the elements of the same cluster are to each other. separation measures: quantify the level of separation between clusters. internal indices are usually employed in conjunction with two clustering algorithm families: hierarchical clustering algorithms and partitional algorithms. for partitional algorithms, metrics based on the proximity matrix, as well as metrics of cohesion and separation, such as the silhouette coefficient, are often used. for hierarchical algorithms, the cophenetic coefficient is the most common. partitional methods in general, the internal validation value of a set of \\(k\\) clusters can be decomposed as the sum of the validation values for each cluster: \\begin{align} \\text{general validity} = \\sum_{i=1}^k w_i \\text{validity}(c_i) \\end{align} this measure of validity can be cohesion, separation, or some combination of both. quite often, the weights that appear in the previous expression correspond to cluster size. the individual measures of cohesion and separation are defined as follows: \\begin{align} \\text{cohesion}(c_i) = \\sum_{x \\in c_i, y \\in c_i} \\text{proximity}(x, y) \\end{align} \\begin{align} \\text{separation}(c_i, c_j) = \\sum_{x \\in c_i, y \\in c_j} \\text{proximity}(x, y) \\end{align} it should be noted that the cohesion metric defined above is equivalent to the cluster sse [sum of squared errors]: \\begin{align} sse(c_i) = \\sum_{x \\in c_i} d(c_i, x)^2 = \\frac{1}{2m_i} \\sum_{x \\in c_i} \\sum_{y \\in c_i} d(x, y)^2 \\end{align} likewise, we can maximize the distance between clusters using a separation metric. this approach leads to the between group sum of squares, or ssb: \\begin{align} ssb = \\sum_{i = 1}^k m_i d(c_i, c)^2 = \\frac{1}{2k} \\sum_{i=1}^k \\sum_{j = 1}^k \\frac{m}{k} d(c_i, c_j)^2 \\end{align} where \\(c_i\\) is the mean of the \\(i\\)th cluster and \\(c\\) is the overall mean. instead of dealing with separate metrics for cohesion and separation, there are several metrics that try to quantify the level of separation and cohesion in a single measure: the calisnki-harabasz coefficient: it is a measure based on the internal dispersion of clusters and the dispersion between clusters. we would choose the number of clusters that maximizes the ch. \\begin{align} ch = \\frac{\\frac{ssb_m}{m - 1}}{\\frac{sse_m}{m}} \\end{align} the dunn index is the ratio of the smallest distance between data from different clusters and the largest distance between clusters. again, this ratio should be maximized: \\begin{align} d = \\min_{1 < i < k} \\left\\{\\min_{1 < j < k, i\\neq j} \\left\\{\\frac{\\delta (c_i, c_j)}{\\max_{1 < l < k} \\{\\delta (c_l)\\}}\\right\\}\\right\\} \\end{align} the xie-beni score was designed for fuzzy clustering, but it can applied to hard clustering. it is a ratio whose numerator estimates the level of compaction of the data within the same cluster and whose denominator estimates the level of separation of the data from different clusters: \\begin{align} xb = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{k=1}^m u^2_{ik} ||x_i - c_k||^2}{n_{t \\neq s} \\min (||c_t - c_s||^2)} \\end{align} the ball-hall index is a dispersion measure based on the quadratic distances of the cluster points with respect to their centroid \\begin{align} bh = \\frac{sse_m}{m} \\end{align} the hartigan index is based on the logarithmic relationship between the sum of squares within the cluster and the sum of squares between clusters: \\begin{align} h = \\log \\left(\\frac{ssb_m}{sse_m}\\right) \\end{align} the xu coefficient takes into account the dimensionality \\(d\\) of the data, the number \\(n\\) of data examples, and the sum of squared errors \\(sse_m\\) form \\(m\\) clusters: \\begin{align} x_u = d \\log_2 \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{sse_m}{dn^2}}\\right) + \\log m \\end{align} the silhouette coefficient is the most common way to combine the metrics of cohesion and separation in a single measure. its computation is divided into four steps: compute the average intracluster distance for each example \\(i\\): \\(a(i) = \\frac{1}{|c_a|} \\sum_{j \\in c_a, i \\neq j} d(i, j)\\) compute the minimum intercluster distance for each example \\(i\\): \\(b(i) = \\min_{c_b \\neq c_a} \\frac{1}{|c_b|} \\sum_{j \\in c_b} d(i, j)\\) compute the silhouette coefficient for each example \\(i\\): \\(s(i) = \\frac{b(i) - a(i)}{max(a(i), b(i))}\\) compute the silhouette puntuation as the average of the silhouette coefficients: \\(s = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i = 1}^n s(i)\\) the silhouette is defined in the interval \\([-1, 1]\\). positive values indicate a high separation between clusters, negative values are an indication that the clusters are mixed with each other. when the silhouette coefficient is zero, it is an an indication that the data are uniformly distributed throughout the euclidean space. unfortunately, one of the main drawbacks of the silhouette coefficient is its high computational complexity. cohesion and separation metrics are not the only validation method available for partitional clustering techniques. in fact, cohesion and separation metrics do not perform well when it comes to analyzing results obtained by algorithms based on density analysis. one way to validate clustering is by comparing the actual proximity matrix with an ideal version based on the provided clustering by the algorithm. if we reorder rows and columns so that all examples of the same cluster appear together, the ideal proximity matrix has a block diagonal structure. high correlation between the actual and ideal proximity matrices indicates that examples in the same cluster are close to each other, although it may not be a good measure for density-based clustering. imagine you have a table where each row and column represents a data point, and the cells contain numbers indicating how similar or close those data points are to each other. now, if you group similar data points together into clusters, you can rearrange the rows and columns of the table so that all the data points within each cluster are together. when you do this, the table will have a diagonal pattern where each cluster forms a block of closely related data points. this diagonal pattern is what we mean by a \"block diagonal structure\" in the context of a proximity matrix. unfortunately, the mere construction of the whole proximity matrix is computationally expensive. hierarchical methods cophenetic correlation coefficient the cophenetic distance between two examples is the proximity at which an agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm puts the examples in the same cluster for the first time. the cophenetic correlation coefficient (cpcc) is defined as he correlation between the entries of the cophenetic matrix \\(p_c\\) containing cophenetic distances, and the proximity matrix \\(p\\), containing similarities. the cophenetic correlation coefficient is then defined as: \\begin{align} \\text{cpcc} = \\frac{\\sum_{i < j} (d_{ij} - \\overline{d})(d_{ij}^* - \\overline{d}^*)}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{i < j} (d_{ij} - \\overline{d})^2 \\sum_{i < j}(d_{ij}^* - \\overline{d}^*)}} \\end{align} where \\(d_{ij}\\) is the distance between the example pair \\((i, j)\\), \\(d_{ij}^*\\) is their cophenetic distance, \\(\\overline{d}\\) is the average of the distances in the proximity matrix and \\(d_{ij}^*\\) is the average of the cophenetic distances in the cophenetic matrix. \\begin{align} \\overline{d} = \\frac{\\sum_{i < j} d_{ij}}{2(n^2 - n)} \\end{align} \\begin{align} \\overline{d}^* = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i < j} (d_{ij} - d_{ij}^*)^2}{\\sum_{i < j} (d_{ij}^*)^2}} \\end{align} the cophenetic correlation coefficient is a value in the interval \\([â1, 1]\\). high cpcc values indicate a high level of similarity between the two matrices, an indication that the clustering algorithm has been able to identify the underlying structure of its input data. hubert statistic first, concordance are discordance are defined for pairs of examples. a pair \\((i, j)\\) is concordant when \\(((v_{p_i} < v_{c_i}) \\& (v_{p_j} < v_{c_j}))\\) or \\(((v_{p_i} > v_{c_i}) \\& (v_{p_j} > v_{c_j}))\\). and it is said to be discordant when \\(((v_{p_i} < v_{c_i}) \\& (v_{p_j} > v_{c_j}))\\) or \\(((v_{p_i} > v_{c_i}) \\& (v_{p_j} < v_{c_j}))\\). therefore, a pair is neither concordant nor discordant if \\(v_{p_i} = v_{c_i}\\) or \\(v_{p_j} = v_{c_j}\\). let \\(s_+\\) and \\(s_-\\) be the number of concordant and discordant pairs, respectively. then, the hubert coefficient is defined as: \\begin{align} \\gamma = \\frac{s_+ - s_-}{s_+ + s_-} \\end{align} the hubert statistic is between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\). it has been mainly used to compare the results of two hierarchical clustering algorithms. a higher hubert \\(\\gamma\\) value corresponds to a better clustering of data. external validation external validation proceeds by incorporating additional information in the clustering validation process, i.e. external class labels for the training examples. we want to compare the result of a clustering algorithm \\(c = \\{c_1, c_2, \\cdots, c_m\\}\\) to a potentially different partition of data \\(p = \\{p_1, p_2, \\cdots, p_s\\}\\) which might represent the expert knowledge of the analyst (his experience or intuition), prior knowledge of the data in the form of class labels, the results obtained by another clustering algorithm, or simply a grouping considered to be \"correct\". in order to carry out this analysis, a contingency matrix must be built to evaluate the clusters detected by the algorithm that encompasses the following data: \\(tp\\): the number of data pairs found in the same cluster, both in \\(c\\) and in \\(p\\). \\(fp\\): the number of data pairs found in the same cluster in \\(c\\) but in different clusters in \\(p\\). \\(fn\\): the number of data pairs found in different clusters in \\(c\\) but in the same cluster in \\(p\\). \\(tn\\): the number of data pairs found in different clusters, both in \\(c\\) and in \\(p\\). matching sets several measures can be defined to measure the similarity between the clusters in \\(c\\), obtained by the clustering algorithm, and the clusters if \\(p\\), corresponding to our prior (external) knowledge: precision: \\(pr = \\frac{tp}{tp + fp}\\) recall: \\(r = \\frac{tp}{tp + fn}\\) f-measure: \\(f_{\\alpha} = \\frac{1 + \\alpha}{\\frac{1}{pr} + \\frac{\\alpha}{r}}\\) quite often, precision and recall are evenly combined with an unweighted harmonic mean (\\(\\alpha = 1\\)): \\begin{align} f = \\frac{2 \\cdot pr \\cdot r}{pr + r} \\end{align} purity: evaluates whether each cluster contains only examples from the same class: \\begin{align} u = \\sum_{i} p_i (\\max_j \\frac{p_{ij}}{p_i}) \\end{align} where \\(p_i = \\frac{n_i}{n}\\), \\(p_j = \\frac{n_j}{n}\\) and \\(p_{ij} = \\frac{n_{ij}}{n}\\). where \\(n_{ij}\\) are the number of examples belonging to the class \\(i\\) found in the cluster \\(j\\) and \\(n_i\\) is the number of examples in the cluster \\(i\\). peer-to-peer correlation a second family of measures for external validation are based on the correlation between pairs, i.e. they seek to measure the similarity between two partitions under equal conditions, such as the result of a grouping process for the same set, but by means of two different methods \\(c\\) and \\(p\\). the jaccard coefficient: \\(j = \\frac{tp}{tp + fp + fn}\\) the rand coefficient: \\(rand = \\frac{tp + tn}{m}\\) the folkes and mallows coefficient: \\(fm = \\sqrt{\\frac{tp}{tp + fp} \\cdot \\frac{tp}{tp + fn}}\\) the hubert statistical coefficient: \\(\\gamma = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{n - 1} \\sum_{j = i + 1}^{n} x_{ij} y_{ij}\\) where \\(n_{ij}\\) are the number of examples belonging to the class \\(i\\) found in the cluster \\(j\\) and \\(n_i\\) is the number of examples in the cluster \\(i\\). measures based on information theory this family includes basic measures such as entropy and mutual information, as well as their respective normalized variants. entropy: \\(h = - \\sum_{i} p_i \\left(\\sum_{j} \\frac{p_{ij}}{p_i} \\log \\frac{p_{ij}}{p_i}\\right)\\) mutual information: \\(mi = \\sum_{i} \\sum_{j} p_{ij} \\log \\frac{p_{ij}}{p_i p_j}\\) where \\(p_{ij} = \\frac{n_{ij}}{n}\\) and \\(p_i = \\frac{n_i}{n}\\). hyperparameter tuning even though external validation metrics can help us evaluate whether the obtained clusters closely match the underlying categories in the training data, which the clustering algorithm tries to identify without externally-provided class labels, those metrics cannot address other issues such as the right number of clusters for our current data set. hyperparameter tuning tries to determine, for the different possible values of the parameters in \\(p_{alg}\\) , which set of parameter values is the most suitable for our particular clustering problem. we could proceed in the following way: when the algorithm does not include the number of clusters \\(n_c\\) among its parameters, we run the algorithm with different values for its parameters so that we can determine their largest range for which \\(n_c\\) remains constant. later, we choose as parameter values the values in the middle of this range. when the algorithm parameters palg include the desired number of clusters \\(n_c\\), we run the algorithm for a range of values for \\(n_c\\). for each value of \\(n_c\\), we run the algorithm multiple times using different sets of values (i.e. starting from different initial conditions) and choose the value that optimizes our desired validation metric. when we just want to determine the ârightâ number of clusters, \\(n_c\\), plotting the validation results for different values of \\(n_c\\) can sometimes show a relevant change in the validation metric, commonly referred to as a \"knee\" or \"elbow\". hyperparameter tuning can then be seen as a combinatorial optimization problem using different strategies: grid search: is based on a systematic exploration of the hyperparameter space. random search: chooses parameter configurations at random. smart search techniques try to optimize the problem of searching for hyperparameter values. different strategies can be implemented, such as bayesian optimization using gaussian processes and evolutionary optimization using genetic algorithms or evolution strategies. $(\"pre\").each(function (index, item) { $(item).html(\"<code>\" + $(item).html() + \"</code>\"); }); hljs.highlightall(); "

    "title": "Cluster Analysis",
    "body": " index search search back cluster analysis cluster analysis, also called data segmentation, has a variety of goals. all relate to grouping or segmenting a collection of objects into subsets or \"clusters\", such that those within each cluster are more closely related to one another than objects assigned to different clusters. the method we use to group these objects depends on what we consider to be similar, and that decision usually comes from what we know about the subject we're studying. an object can be described by a set of measurements, or by its relation to other objects. proximity matrices sometimes the data is represented directly in terms of the proximity (alikeness or affinity) between pairs of objects. this type of data can be represented by an \\(n \\times n\\) matrix \\(d\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of objects, and each element \\(d_{ij}\\) records the proximity between the \\(j\\)th and \\(j\\)th objects. this matrix is then provided as input to the clustering algorithm. most algorithms assume symmetric dissimilarity matrices, so if the original matrix \\(d\\) is not symmetric it must be replaced by \\(\\frac{(d + d^t)}{2}\\). dissimilarities based on attributes since most of the popular clustering algorithms take a dissimilarity matrix as their input, we must first construct pairwise dissimilarities between the observations. by far the most common choice is squared distance: \\begin{align} d_j(x_{ij}, x_{i'j}) = (x_{ij} - x_{i'j})^2 \\end{align} where \\(j\\) denotes the attribute and \\(i, i'\\) denotes the instance. we first discuss alternatives in terms of the attribute type: quantitative variables measurements of this type of variable or attribute are represented by continuous real-valued numbers. one way to do this is by looking at the absolute difference between them: \\begin{align} d(x_i, x_{i'}) = l(|x_i - x_{i'}|) \\end{align} alternatively, clustering can be based on the correlation \\begin{align} \\rho (x_i, x_{i'}) = \\frac{\\sum_{j} (x_{ij} - \\overline{x}_i)(x_{ij} - \\overline{x}_i)}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{j} (x_{ij} - \\overline{x}_i)^2 \\sum_j(x_{ij} - \\overline{x}_i)^2}} \\end{align} ordinal variables error measures for ordinal variables are generally defined by replacing their \\(m\\) original values with: \\begin{align} \\frac{i - \\frac{1}{2}}{m}, i = 1, \\cdots, m \\end{align} in the prescribed order of their original values. they are then treated as quantitative variables on this scale. categorical variables if the variable assumes \\(m\\) distinct values, these can be arranged in a symmetric \\(m \\times m\\) matrix with elements: \\begin{align} m_{ij} = \\begin{cases} 0 & x_{i} = x_{j} \\\\ 1 & x_{i} \\neq x_{j} \\\\ \\end{cases} \\end{align} object dissimilarity next we define a procedure for combining the \\(p\\)-individual attribute dissimilarities \\(d_j(x_{ij},x_{i'j}), j = 1,2, \\cdots, p\\) into a single overall measure of dissimilarity \\(d(x_i, x_i')\\). this is nearly always done by means of a weighted average: \\begin{align} d(x_i, x_{i'}) = \\sum_{j=1}^p w_j d_j(x_{ij}, x_{i'j}) \\end{align} where: \\begin{align} \\sum_{j=1}^p w_j = 1 \\end{align} here \\(w_j\\) is a weight assigned to the \\(j\\)th attribute regulating the relative influence of that variable in determining the overall dissimilarity between objects. if the goal is to discover natural groupings in the data, some attributes may exhibit more of a grouping tendency than others. variables that are more relevant in separating the groups should be assigned a higher influence in defining object dissimilarity. giving all attributes equal influence in this case will tend to obscure the groups to the point where a clustering algorithm cannot uncover them. specifying an appropriate dissimilarity measure is far more important in obtaining success with clustering than choice of clustering algorithm. clustering algorithms clustering algorithms fall into three distinct types: combinatorial algorithms: work directly on the observed data with no direct reference to an underlying probability model. mixture modeling: supposes that the data is an i.i.d sample from some population described by a probability density function. mode seeking: take a nonparametric perspective, attempting to directly estimate distinct modes of the probability density function combinatorial algorithms each observation is uniquely labeled by an integer \\(i \\in {1, \\cdots, n}\\). one seeks the particular encoder \\(c^*(i)\\) that assigns the \\(i\\)th observation to the \\(k\\)th cluster that satisfies the required goal based on the dissimilarities \\(d(x_i, x_{i'})\\). the \"parameters\" of the procedure are the individual cluster assignments for each of the \\(n\\) observations. these are adjusted so as to minimize a \"loss\" function. since the goal is to assign close points to the same cluster, a natural loss function would be: \\begin{align} w(c) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{k=1}^k \\sum_{c(i) = k}\\sum_{c(i') = k} d(x_i, d_{i'}) \\end{align} this measure tells us how close together the things in the same group are. it is sometimes referred to as the \"within cluster\" point scatter. the total point scatter is given by: \\begin{align} t = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^n\\sum_{i'=1}^n d_{ii'} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{k=1}^k\\sum_{c(i) = k} \\left(\\sum_{c(i') = k} d_{ii'} + \\sum_{c(i') \\neq k} d_{ii'}\\right) \\end{align} this basically divides, for each \\(i\\)th instance on cluster \\(k\\), so \\(c(i) = k\\), the distances into two categories, distances to instances on the same cluster \\(\\sum_{c(i') = k} d_{ii'}\\), and distances to instances on a different cluster \\(\\sum_{c(i') \\neq k} d_{ii'}\\). that is: \\begin{align} t = w(c) + b(c) \\end{align} where \\(b(c)\\) is the between-cluster point scatter: \\begin{align} b(c) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{k=1}^k \\sum_{c(i) = k} \\sum_{c(i')\\neq k} d_{ii'} \\end{align} so, minimizing \\(w(c)\\) is equivalent to maximizing \\(b(c)\\) given \\(w(c) = t - b(c)\\). cluster analysis by combinatorial optimization is straightforward in principle. one simply minimizes \\(w\\) or equivalently maximizes \\(b\\) over all possible assignments of the \\(n\\) data points to \\(k\\) clusters. unfortunately, such optimization by complete enumeration is feasible only for very small data sets. for this reason, practical clustering algorithms are able to examine only a very small fraction of all possible encoders \\(k = c(i)\\). the goal is to identify a small subset that is likely to contain the optimal one, or at least a good suboptimal partition. such feasible strategies are based on iterative greedy descent. an initial partition is specified. at each iterative step, the cluster assignments are changed in such a way that the value of the criterion is improved from its previous value. clustering algorithms of this type differ in their prescriptions for modifying the cluster assignments at each iteration. when the prescription is unable to provide an improvement, the algorithm terminates with the current assignments as its solution. however, these algorithms converge to local optima which may be highly suboptimal when compared to the global optimum. k-means the k-means algorithm is one of the most popular iterative descent clustering methods, which uses the squared euclidean distance. so the within point-scatter can be written as: \\begin{align} w(c) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{k=1}^k\\sum_{c(i) = k}\\sum_{c(i')=k} ||x_i - x_{i'}||^2 \\end{align} \\begin{align} = \\sum_{k=1}^k n_k \\sum_{c(i) = k} ||x_i - \\overline{x}_k||^2 \\end{align} where \\(\\overline{x}_k\\) is the mean vector associated with the \\(k\\)th cluster and \\(n_k = \\sum_{i=1}^n i(c(i) = k)\\) is the number of instances on the \\(k\\)th cluster. therefore the goal is to group the \\(n\\) observations into \\(k\\) clusters in a way that minimizes the average difference between each observation and the mean of its cluster. \\begin{align} c^* \\min_{c} \\sum_{k=1}^k n_k \\sum_{c(i) = k} ||x_i - \\overline{x}_k||^2 \\end{align} can be obtained by noting that for any set of observations \\(s\\): \\begin{align} \\overline{x}_s = \\arg \\min_{m} \\sum_{i \\in s} ||x_i - m||^2 \\end{align} that is we defined the centroid for \\(s\\) as the point \\(m\\) that minimizes the sum of distances for each instance on \\(s\\). hence we can obtain \\(c^*\\) by solving the enlarged optimization problem: \\begin{align} \\min_{\\{c, m_k\\}^k_1} \\sum_{k=1}^k n_k \\sum_{c(i) = k} ||x_i - m_k||^2 \\end{align} where for each cluster \\(k\\), we search for the encoder \\(c\\) and the optimal centroid \\(m_k\\). thus the optmimization process can be performed in two steps as seen in algorithm 14.1. on (1) we obtain the optimal centroids \\(m_i, i = 1, \\cdots, k\\), and on (2) we try to find the best encoder \\(c\\) given the set of centroids \\(\\{m_1, \\cdots, m_k\\}\\). gaussian mixtures as soft k-means clustering the k-means clustering procedure is closely related to the em algorithm for estimating a certain gaussian mixture model. the e-step of the em algorithm assigns \"responsibilities\" for each data point based in its relative density under each mixture component (cluster). while the m-step recomputes the component density parameters based on the current responsibilities. where the relative density is a monotone function of the euclidean distance between the data point and the mixture center. hence in this setup em is a \"soft\" version of k-means clustering, making probabilistic (rather than deterministic) assignments of points to cluster centers. as \\(\\sigma^2\\) tends to \\(1\\), these probabilities become \\(0\\) and \\(1\\), and the two methods coincide: vector quantization vector quantization (vq) is a technique used in data compression, particularly in the compression of digital signals or images. it involves representing a large set of data points (vectors) by a smaller set of representative values, called codewords or centroids. these centroids are selected from the original data set and are used to approximate the original data. by replacing groups of similar data points with these representative values, vector quantization can significantly reduce the amount of data needed to represent the information while minimizing the loss of quality. in this example of vector quantization, given an image of \\(1024\\times 1024\\) pixels we start by dividing the image into small blocks of \\(2\\times 2\\). each block, which contains four pixels, is treated like a tiny picture of its own. each of the \\(512 \\times 512\\) blocks of four numbers is regarded as vector in \\(\\mathbb{r}^4\\). then, using k-means clustering, we group these blocks together based on their similarity. the clustering process is called the encoding step, and the collection of centroids is called the codebook. why do we expect vq to work at all? the reason is that for typical everyday images like photographs, many of the blocks look the same. what we have described is known as lossy compression, since our images are degraded versions of the original. k-medoids the k-means algorithm can be generalized for use with arbitrarily defined dissimilarities \\(d(x_i, x_{i'})\\). the process of finding the centers of the clusters stays similar, but the way we measure similarity can change. this makes the algorithm versatile and applicable to various types of data. this gives way to the k-medoids algorithm: practical issues in order to apply k-means or k-medoids one must select the number of clusters \\(k^*\\) and an initialization. the latter can be defined by specifying an initial set of centers \\(\\{m_1,\\cdots,m_k\\}\\) or \\(\\{i_1, \\cdots,i_k\\}\\) or an initial encoder \\(c(i)\\). a choice for the number of clusters \\(k\\) depends on the goal. for data segmentation \\(k\\) is usually defined as part of the problem. data-based methods for estimating \\(k^*\\) typically examine the withincluster dissimilarity \\(w_k\\) as a function of the number of clusters \\(k\\). the corresponding values generally decrease with increasing \\(k\\). thus cross-validation techniques, so useful for model selection in supervised learning, cannot be utilized in this context. as we increase the number of clusters, the solution quality will improve because more natural groups will be captured separately. so, if we keep adding more clusters beyond the true number (\\(k > k^*\\)), some estimated clusters will start to split the real groups. however, splitting a group that's already close together won't improve the solution as much as properly separating two distinct groups. to the extent this scenario is realized, there will be a sharp decrease in successive differences in criterion value, \\(w_k â w_{k+1}\\), at \\(k = k^*\\). that is, \\(\\{w_k â w_{k+1} |k < k^*\\} \\geq \\{w_k â w_{k+1} |k \\geq k^*\\}\\). an estimate \\(\\hat{k}*\\) for \\(k^*\\) is then obtained by identifying a âkinkâ in the plot of \\(w_k\\) as a function of \\(k\\). the recently proposed gap statistic compares the shape of a curve based on our data to a curve we'd get if the data were spread out evenly. we're looking for a point where there's a big gap between these two curves. this point tells us the best number of clusters for our data. if \\(g(k)\\) is the gap curve at \\(k\\) clusters, the formal rule for estimating \\(k^*\\) is: \\begin{align} k^* = \\text{argmin}_{k} \\{k | g(k) \\geq g(k + 1 - s'_{k + 1}) \\} \\end{align} where \\(s_k\\) is the standard deviation. the following figure shows and example on how to choose the optimal number of clusters: hierarchical clustering as the name suggests, they produce hierarchical representations in which the clusters at each level of the hierarchy are created by merging clusters at the next lower level. at the lowest level, each cluster contains a single observation. at the highest level there is only one cluster containing all of the data. strategies for hierarchical clustering divide into two basic paradigms: agglomerative (bottom-up) and divisive (top-down). each level of the hierarchy represents a particular grouping of the data into disjoint clusters of observations. the entire hierarchy represents an ordered sequence of such groupings. it is up to the user to decide which level (if any) actually represents a \"natural\" clustering a dendrogram provides a highly interpretable complete description of the hierarchical clustering in a graphical format. cutting the dendrogram horizontally at a particular height partitions the data into disjoint clusters represented by the vertical lines that intersect it. the height at which we cut represents the level of similarity required to form a cluster. generally, groups that merge at higher levels in the dendrogram are considered more significant clusters. however, it's essential to be cautious when interpreting dendrograms because different clustering methods or slight changes in the data can lead to different dendrogram structures. also, dendrogram interpretations are only valid if the data truly exhibits the hierarchical structure imposed by the clustering algorithm. this can be assesed using the cophenetic correlation coefficient, it measures the correlation between the cophenetic dissimilarities \\(c_{ii'}\\) and the distances between observations in the original data \\(d_{ii'}\\). the cophenetic dissimilarity \\(c_{ii'}\\) between two observations \\((i, i')\\) is the intergroup dissimilarity at which observations \\(i\\) and \\(i'\\) are first joined together in the same cluster. agglomerative clustering agglomerative clustering starts with each observation as its own cluster. then, at each step, it merges the two closest clusters together until there's only one big cluster left. to measure dissimilarity between two clusters, let's call them \\(g\\) and \\(h\\). we look at all the pairs of observations, one from \\(g\\) and one from \\(h\\), and find the dissimilarity between them. single linkage (sl) or nearest neighbour agglomerative clustering chooses the closest pair of observations between the two clusters as the measure of dissimilarity between the clusters: \\begin{align} d_{sl}(g, h) = \\min_{i \\in g, i' \\in h} d_{ii'} \\end{align} complete linkage (cl) or furthest-neighbor technique agglomerative clustering measures the dissimilarity between two clusters as the distance the pair of observations that are the farthest apart. \\begin{align} d_{cl}(g, h) = \\max_{i \\in g, i' \\in h} d_{ii'} \\end{align} group average (ga) clustering uses the average dissimilarity between the groups: \\begin{align} d_{ga}(g, h) = \\frac{1}{n_g n_h} \\sum_{i \\in g} \\sum_{i \\in h} d_{ii'} \\end{align} where \\(n_g\\) and \\(n_h\\) are the respective number of observations in each group. if the data shows clear clusters that are close together and distinct from each other, all three methodsâsingle linkage, complete linkage, and average linkageâwill give similar results. however, if the data doesn't exhibit this pattern, the results of the three methods will differ. single linkage tends to join clusters even if just one pair of observations is close together, which can lead to long chains of connections between clusters. this phenomenon is known as chaining. complete linkage will tend to produce compact clusters with small diameters because it considers two groups close only if all the observations in their combined set are similar. sometimes it may violate the rule that observations within a cluster should be closer to each other than to observations in other clusters. group average clustering strikes a balance between single and complete linkage. it tries to make clusters compact while keeping them relatively far apart. however, its outcome can be affected by how the dissimilarities between observations are measured. changing the measurement scale can change the clustering result. in contrast, single and complete linkage methods are not affected by such changes in scale. divisive clustering divisive clustering starts with the entire dataset as one cluster and then splits it into smaller clusters step by step. this method isn't as widely studied as agglomerative clustering, but it has been explored, especially in engineering contexts like compression. one potential advantage of divisive clustering is when you want to divide the data into only a few clusters. divisive methods can be used recursively with techniques like k-means or k-medoids to split clusters into smaller ones. however the way you begin the splitting process at each step can influence the final outcome. a method has been developed to overcome this limitations. the divisive algorithm, proposed by macnaughton smith et al. (1965), is defined as: puts all observations in one big cluster called \\(g\\). it picks the observation that's farthest on average from all the others and makes it the first member of a new cluster called \\(h\\). at each successive step that observation in \\(g\\) whose average distance from those in \\(h\\), minus that for the remaining observations in \\(g\\) is largest, is transferred to \\(h\\). this continues until there are no more observations in \\(g\\) that are closer to those in \\(h\\). this splitting procedure is repeated for each new cluster formed at the previous level, creating a hierarchical structure. kaufman and rousseeuw (1990) suggest choosing the cluster with the largest diameter for splitting at each level, but another option is to pick the one with the largest average dissimilarity among its members. $(\"pre\").each(function (index, item) { $(item).html(\"<code>\" + $(item).html() + \"</code>\"); }); hljs.highlightall(); "

    "body": " index search search back random forests definition the idea in random forests (ilustrated on the image below) is to improve the variance reduction of bagging by reducing the correlation between the trees, without increasing the variance too much. this is achieved in the tree-growing process through random selection of the input variables. an average of \\(b\\) i.i.d. random variables, each with variance \\(\\sigma^2\\), has variance \\(\\frac{1}{b}\\sigma^2\\). if the variables are simply i.d. (identically distributed, but not necessarily independent) with positive pairwise correlation Ï, the variance of the average is: \\begin{align} \\rho\\sigma^2 + \\frac{1 - \\rho}{b}\\sigma^2 \\end{align} as \\(b\\) increases, the second term disappears, but the first remains, and hence the size of the correlation of pairs of bagged trees limits the benefits of averaging. when growing a tree on a bootstrapped dataset before each split, select \\(m \\leq p\\) of the input variables at random as candidates for splitting. after \\(b\\) such trees \\(\\{t(x; \\theta_b)\\}_1^b\\) are grown, the random forest (regression) predictor is: \\begin{align} \\hat{f}_{rf}^b(x) = \\frac{1}{b}\\sum_{b=1}^b t(x; \\theta_b) \\end{align} where \\(\\theta_b\\) characterizes the bth random forest tree in terms of split variables, cutpoints at each node, and terminal-node values. intuitively, reducing \\(m\\) will reduce the correlation between any pair of trees in the ensemble. details of random forests for classification, the default value for \\(m\\) is \\(\\lfloor \\sqrt{p} \\rfloor\\) and the minimum node size is one. for regression, the default value for \\(m\\) is \\(\\lfloor \\frac{p}{3} \\rfloor\\) and the minimum node size is five. in practice the best values for these parameters will depend on the problem, and they should be treated as tuning parameters (hyperparamters). variable importance at each split in each tree, the improvement in the split-criterion is the importance measure attributed to the splitting variable, and is accumulated over all the trees in the forest separately for each variable. random forests also use the oob samples to construct a different variable importance measure. when the bth tree is grown, the oob samples are passed down the tree, and the prediction accuracy is recorded. then the values for the jth variable are randomly permuted in the oob samples, and the accuracy is again computed. the decrease in accuracy as a result of this permuting is averaged over all trees, and is used as a measure of the importance of variable \\(j\\) in the random forest. proximity plots in growing a random forest, an \\(n \\times n\\) proximity matrix is accumulated for the training data. such that the entry \\(ij\\) contains the number of trees for which the oob sample \\(x_i\\) and the oob sample \\(x_j\\) are on the same terminal node. this proximity matrix is then represented in two dimensions using multidimensional scaling like the following example: the proximity plot gives an indication of which observations are effectively close together in the eyes of the random forest classifier. random forests and overfitting when the number of variables \\(p\\) is large, but the fraction of relevant variables small, random forests are likely to perform poorly with small \\(m\\). at each split the chance can be small that the relevant variables will be selected. another claim is that random forests âcannot overfitâ the data. $(\"pre\").each(function (index, item) { $(item).html(\"<code>\" + $(item).html() + \"</code>\"); }); hljs.highlightall(); "

    "body": " index search search back bagging introduction the decision trees discussed suffer from high variance. in contrast, a procedure with low variance will yield similar results if applied repeatedly to distinct data sets. bootstrap aggregation, or bagging, is a procedure for reducing the variance of a statistical learning method. recall that given a set of \\(n\\) independent observations \\(z_1, \\cdots, z_n\\) each with variance \\(\\sigma^2\\), the variance of the mean \\(\\overline{z}\\) of the observations is given by \\(\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}\\). so, averaging a set of observations reduces variance. thus, to reduce the variance and increase the prediction accuracy of a statistical learning method is to take many training sets from the population, build a separate prediction model using each training set, and average the resulting predictions. using \\(b\\) separate training sets, and average them in order to obtain a single low-variance statistical learning model, given by: \\begin{align} \\hat{f}_{avg}(x) = \\frac{1}{b}\\sum_{b=1}^b \\hat{f}^b(x) \\end{align} for each bootstrap sample \\(z^{*b}, b = 1, 2, \\cdots, b\\), we fit our model, giving prediction \\(\\hat{f}^{*b}(x)\\). the bagging estimate is defined by: \\begin{align} \\hat{f}_{bag}(x) = \\frac{1}{b}\\sum_{b=1}^b \\hat{f}^{*b}(x) \\end{align} bagging on regression trees to apply bagging to regression trees, we simply construct \\(b\\) regression trees using \\(b\\) bootstrapped training sets, and average the resulting predictions. these trees are grown deep, and are not pruned. hence each individual tree has high variance, but low bias. averaging these b trees reduces the variance. bagging on decision trees how can bagging be extended to a classification problem where y is qualitative? for a given test observation, we can record the class predicted by each of the \\(b\\) trees, and take a majority vote. suppose our tree produces a classifier \\(\\hat{g}(x)\\) for a \\(k\\)-class response. then the bagged estimate \\(\\hat{f}_{bag}(x)\\) is a \\(k\\)-vector \\([p_1(x), p_2(x), \\cdots, p_k(x)]\\), with \\(p_k(x)\\) equal to the proportion of trees predicting class \\(k\\) at \\(x\\). the bagged classifier selects the class with the most votes from the \\(b\\) trees, \\(\\hat{g}_{bag}(x) = \\arg \\max_k \\hat{f}_{bag}(x)\\). often we require the class-probability estimates at \\(x\\). for many classifiers \\(\\hat{g}(x)\\) there is already an underlying function \\(\\hat{f}(x)\\) that estimates the class probabilities at \\(x\\) (for trees, the class proportions in the terminal node). an alternative bagging strategy is to average these instead. the number of trees \\(b\\) is not a critical parameter with bagging; using a very large value of \\(b\\) will not lead to overfitting. in practice we use a value of \\(b\\) sufficiently large that the error has settled down. note that bagging a good classifier can make it better, but bagging a bad classifier can make it worse. out-of-bag error estimation there is a very straightforward way to estimate the test error of a bagged model one can show that on average, each bagged tree makes use of around two-thirds of the observations. the observations not used to fit a given bagged tree are referred to as the out-of-bag (oob) observations. an oob prediction can be obtained for each of the \\(n\\) observations on the oob observation set, from which the overall oob mse (for a regression problem) or classification error (for a classification problem) can be computed. the resulting oob error is a valid estimate of the test error for the bagged model. variable importance measures although the collection of bagged trees is much more difficult to interpret than a single tree, one can obtain an overall summary of the importance of each predictor using the rss (for bagging regression trees) or the gini index (for bagging classification trees) in the case of bagging regression trees, we can record the total amount that the rss is decreased due to splits over a given predictor, averaged over all \\(b\\) trees. for classification trees, we can add up the total amount that the gini index is decreased by splits over a given predictor, averaged over all \\(b\\) trees. advantages of ensemble models performance: it improves single models' perfomance. robustness: reduces predictions' variance. so it also improves the equilibrium between bias and variance. how to generate diversity manipulating instances: selecting a different subset of instances for each model. manipulating features: selecting a different subset of features for each model. manipulating models' definition: selecting different hyperparameters, optimization algorithm for ach model. hybridation: mix any of the previous practices. ensemble algorithms bagging models are trained concurrently with different data sets generated using bootstrapping. boosting construye mÃºltiples modelos (tÃ­picamente modelos del mismo tipo) secuenciales, cada uno de los cuales aprende a corregir los errores de predicciÃ³n de un modelo anterior en la cadena. el objetivo es desarrollar un modelo fuerte a partir de muchos modelos dÃ©biles especialmente diseÃ±ados que se combinan mediante votaciÃ³n simple o promediando. staking construye mÃºltiples modelos sobre el mismo conjunto de datos, tÃ­picamente modelos de diferentes tipos (modelos de nivel 0); y un modelo supervisado o meta modelo (modelo de nivel 1) que aprende cÃ³mo combinar mejor las predicciones de los modelos primarios. model of experts podemos dividir el espacio de caracterÃ­sticas de entrada en subespacios segÃºn algÃºn conocimiento de dominio del problema. luego se puede entrenar un modelo en cada subespacio del problema, convirtiÃ©ndose de hecho en un experto en el subproblema especÃ­fico. luego, un modelo aprende a quÃ© experto recurrir para predecir nuevos ejemplos en el futuro. $(\"pre\").each(function (index, item) { $(item).html(\"<code>\" + $(item).html() + \"</code>\"); }); hljs.highlightall(); "

    "body": " index search search back gradient boosting numerical optimization via gradient imagine you have a machine learning model that makes predictions, but it's not perfect. gradient boosting is like a smart way to teach this model to make better predictions over time. instead of trying to fix all the prediction errors at once, gradient boosting focuses on correcting one error at a time. it does this by looking at the direction where the error is the steepest and making adjustments to improve the prediction in that direction. by repeating this process step by step, the model gradually gets better at making predictions, leading to more accurate results. so if you have the following function you want to optimize: \\begin{align} l(f) = \\sum_{i=1}^n l(y_i, f(x_i)) \\end{align} where \\(f \\in \\mathbb{r}^n\\) is the prediction function and its evaluation at each instance \\(x_i\\) are the parameteres we want to optimize: \\begin{align} f = \\{f(x_1), \\cdots, f(x_i), \\cdots, f(x_n)\\} \\end{align} therefore the optimization problem with respect to \\(f\\) can be summarized as follows: \\begin{align} \\hat{f} = \\arg \\min_f l(f) \\end{align} solving this entire problem at once may be challenging. to make it easier, numerical optimization procedures break down this big problem into smaller pieces, represented by component vectors. each component vector addresses a specific aspect of the problem. so: \\begin{align} f_{m} = \\sum_{m = 0}^m h_m, h_m \\in \\mathbb{r}^n \\end{align} where \\(f_m\\) represents the final model or prediction function obtained after m iterations or steps of the boosting algorithm. here \\(f_m\\) represents the model at iteration \\(m\\), whereas \\(h_m\\) represents the increment to the model at iteration \\(m\\) it is the component vector added to the current model to move towards the optimized solution. each \\(h_m\\) is induced based on the current parameter vector \\(f_{m-1}\\) and contributes to the overall model improvement. here is a simple layout of how the algorithm optimizes: at the beginning of the gradient boosting process, the initial model \\(f_0\\) is set to an initial guess. as the algorithm progresses through iterations (\\(m = 1, 2, \\cdots, m\\)), each step involves updating the model based on the gradient information to reduce errors in predictions. numerical optimization methods differ in their prescriptions for computing each increment vector \\(h_m\\). steepest descent steepest descent is a method used in optimization to find the minimum value of a function. this method chooses \\(h_m = \\rho_m g_m\\) where \\(\\rho_m\\) is a scalar and \\(g_m\\) is the gradient of \\(l(f_{m-1})\\), that is, the cost function evaluated at values predicted by the \"previous model\". the components of the gradient \\(g_m\\) are defined as follows: \\begin{align} g_{im} = \\left[\\frac{\\delta l(y_i, f(x_i))}{\\delta f(x_i)}\\right]_{f_m(x_i) = f_{m-1}(x_i)} \\end{align} the step length (kinda like the learning rate): \\begin{align} \\rho_m = \\arg \\min_{\\rho} l(f_{m-1} - \\rho g_m) \\end{align} thus, at each step, the predictor is updated as follows: \\begin{align} f_m = f_{m - 1} - \\rho_m g_m \\in \\mathbb{r}^n \\end{align} this updates \\(f_m\\) towards the direction of maximum descent at \\(l(f_{m-1})\\), which is why this is often interpreted as a greedy algorithm. gradient boosting gradient boosting aims to create a strong predictive model by combining multiple weak models. it starts with a simple model and gradually enhances it to minimize errors. at each iteration, a new tree model is fit to the negative gradient of the loss function. the predictions from these trees guide the model towards better predictions. using squared error to measure closeness, this leads us to: \\begin{align} \\tilde{\\theta}_m = \\arg \\min_{\\theta} \\sum_{i=1}^n (-g_{im} - t(x_i; \\theta))^2 \\end{align} this measures how close each prediction \\(t(x_i; \\theta)\\) is to the gradient \\(-g_{im}\\). the negative gradient of the loss function represents the direction in which the model's predictions need to be adjusted to reduce errors. by fitting a new tree to this negative gradient, the model learns how to correct its predictions to move closer to the actual target values. that is at each iteration, the new tree model focuses on capturing the errors or residuals of the current ensemble model. while the exact regions where the new tree makes corrections may not match perfectly with the original model's regions, they are close enough to serve the same purpose of improving the model's accuracy. here the original model is the ensemble model. the following figure summarizes the gradients for commonly used loss functions: implementations of gradient boosting algorithm \\(10.3\\) presents the generic gradient tree-boosting algorithm for regression. specific algorithms are obtained by inserting different loss criteria \\(l(y,f(x))\\). start with an initial model \\(f_0(x)\\) that minimizes the loss function \\(l(y, f(x))\\). for each boosting round \\(m = 1, \\cdots, m\\): calculate the negative gradient for each data point \\begin{align} r_{im} = -\\left[\\frac{\\delta l(y_i, f(x_i))}{\\delta f(x_i)}\\right]_{f(x_i) = f_{m-1}(x_i)} \\end{align} fit a regression tree to the gradients \\(r_{im}\\), which gives us the regions \\(r_{jm}, j = 1, 2, \\cdots, j_m\\) the step length \\(\\gamma\\) is determined by minimizing the loss using the previous model (\\(f_{m-1}\\)): \\begin{align} \\gamma_{jm} = \\arg \\min_{\\gamma} \\sum_{x_i \\in r_{jm}} l(y_i, f_{m-1}(x_i) + \\gamma) \\end{align} update the model by adding a new tree to the ensemble \\(f_m(x) = f_{m-1}(x) + \\gamma t(x; \\theta_m)\\), where \\(t(x; \\theta)\\) is the new tree model with parameters \\(\\theta_m\\) that corrects the errors in the previous model. the output of the ensemble model is defined as \\(\\hat{f}(x) = f_m(x)\\), that is as the sum of the weaker models. step length the step length \\(\\gamma\\) is crucial in determining how much each new tree should contribute to the ensemble model. it controls the impact of the new tree on the overall model's predictions. the line search aims to find the value of Î³ that minimizes the loss function: \\begin{align} l(f_{m-1} - \\gamma g_m) \\end{align} this means finding the optimal step length that results in the smallest possible loss when updating the model with the new tree. by minimizing the loss function with respect to \\(\\gamma\\), the algorithm is essentially performing a form of gradient descent. characteristics two basic tuning parameters are the number of iterations \\(m\\) and the sizes of each of the constituent trees \\(j_m, m = 1, 2, \\cdots, m\\). the original implementation of this algorithm was called mart for \"multiple additive regression trees\". $(\"pre\").each(function (index, item) { $(item).html(\"<code>\" + $(item).html() + \"</code>\");

    "body": " index search search back practice boosting just like random forest, gbm is an ensemble method. imagine a data set just \\(10\\) examples and two numeric predictor variables, and we are trying to learn to distinguish between two possible classes: circle or cross. the very simplest decision tree we can make has just one node; i will represent it with a straight line in the following diagrams. it scored \\(60\\%\\): six right, four wrong. what we do now is train another very simple tree, but first we modify the training data to give the four rows it got wrong a higher weight. how much of a higher weight? that is where the \"gradient\" bit of gbm comes in. in the next figure the circles and crosses for the wrong items are bigger, and our next tree pays more attention to them. it got a different three items wrong so it still scores \\(60\\%\\). so, for our third tree, we tell it those four are more important; the one it has got wrong twice in a row is the biggest of all. if we stop training here, we end up with three weak models that scored \\(60\\%\\), \\(60\\%\\), and \\(80\\%\\), respectively. however, at least one of each of those three trees got every training row correct. you can see how they can work together to cover each other's weaknesses. gbm naturally focuses attention on the difficult rows in your training data, the ones that are hard to learn. that is good, but it can also be bad. if there is one outlier that each tree keeps getting wrong it is going to get boosted and boosted until it is bigger than the whole universe. this is bad when the data is a mistake instead of an outlier, as it distorts the model's accuracy. the mysterious? well, unlike (simple) decision trees, which can be really good at explaining their thinking, it becomes a bit of a black box. parameters n_trees: how many trees to make. max_depth: how deep are the trees allowed to be. learn_rate: controls the speed at which the model learns learn_rate_annealing: allows you to have the learn_rate start high, then gradually get lower as trees are added. min_rows: how many examples are needed to make a leaf node. low number might lead to overfitting. min_split_improvement: controls how much error improvement must be to perform a split. histogram_type: what type of histogram to use for finding optimal split points. nbins: for numerical columns, build a histogram of (at least) this many bins, then split at the best point. nbins_cat: for categorical columns, build a histogram of (at most) this many bins, then split at the best point. build_tree_one_node: run on one node only. building energy efficiency: default gbm this data set deals with the heating/cooling costs of various house designs. from h2o.estimators.gbm import h2ogradientboostingestimator m = h2ogradientboostingestimator(model_id=\"gbm_defaults\", nfolds=10) m.train(x, y, train) fifty trees were made, each of depth \\(5\\). on cross-validation data, the mse (mean squared error) is \\(2.462\\), and \\(r^2\\) is \\(0.962\\). under âvariable importancesâ (shown next), which can be seen with h2o.varimp(m) you will see it is giving x5 way more importance than any of the others; this is typical for gbm models. how about on the unseen data? m.model_performance(test) is saying mse is \\(2.318\\), better than on the training data. building energy efficiency: tuned gbm i decided to start, this time, with a big random grid search. the hyperparameters tuned are the following: max_depth: the default is \\(5\\), and we tried \\(5,10,15,20,25,30,40,50,60,75,90\\). the ninth best model was max_depth=75, so high values may not be bad, as such, but they donât appear to help. min_rows sample_rate col_sample_rate nbins what about ntrees? instead of trying to tune it, we set it high (\\(1000\\)) and used early stopping. more model results just confirmed the first impression: min_rows of \\(1\\) (or \\(2\\)) is effective with max_depth of \\(5\\), but really poor with higher values. min_rows of \\(10\\) is effective with any value of max_depth, but possibly \\(10\\) to \\(20\\) is best. curiously min_rows of \\(5\\) is mediocre. a sample_rate of \\(0.9\\) or \\(0.95\\) looks best, while there is still no clarity for col_sample_rate or nbins. let's see how it does on the test data, we obtain a mse of \\(1.640\\). this is way better than the default gbmâs 2.462, and also way better than the best tuned random forest model from the previous chapter. mnist: default gbm it is a multinomial classification, trying to look at the \\(784\\) pixels of a handwritten digit, and say which of \\(0\\) to \\(9\\) it is. m = h2o.estimators.h2ogradientboostingestimator(model_id=\"gbm_defaults\") m.train(x, y, train, validation_frame=valid) the confusion matrix on the training data (h2o.confusionmatrix(m)) shows an error rate of \\(2.08\\%\\), while on the validation data it is a bit higher at \\(4.82\\%\\). mse is \\(0.028\\) and \\(0.044\\), respectively. so we have a bit of overfitting on the training data, but not too much. on the test data the error this time is \\(4.44\\%\\) (mse is \\(0.048\\)); in other words, the validation and test sets are giving us similar numbers, which is good. mnist: tuned gbm as usual, the first thing i want to do is switch to using early stopping, so i can then give it lots of trees to work with, with the following parameters: stopping_tolerance = 0.001, stopping_rounds = 3, score_tree_interval = 10, ntrees = 400 just using this, with all other default settings, had some interesting properties training classification score was perfect after 140 trees. validation score was down to \\(2.83\\%\\). the mse and logloss of both the training data and validation data continued to fall, and so did the validation classification score. relative runtime kept increasing. that is, each new tree is taking longer. it finished up with 360 trees, with a very respectable \\(2.17\\%\\) error on the validation data. how can we improve that further? we know there is a lot of examples and variables, so we expect that lower sample ratios will be more effective. in terms of the learn_rate we know low is slower, but betterâ¦ and we have a lot of data. so we use a high (quick) learn_rate for the first grid or two, then lower it later on, once we start to home in on the best parameters. this is going to be a random grid search, because we are going to use a lot of parameters. the first discovery was that a high max_depth was very slow and no better than a shallow one. also min_rows=1 seemed poor. we also found that max_depth=20 was distinctly worse than max_depth=5. we also noticed that min_rows=10 seemed to be doing best, though it was less clear. reducing the three sample rates to \\(1\\) did seem to help, though there was not enough data to draw a confident conclusion. so, another try. we'll leave max_depth and min_rows at their defaults, and just concentrate on testing sampling rates. there was not that much clarity in the parameters, but the best two had col_sample_rate of \\(0.8\\) and sample_rate of \\(0.95\\), whereas sample_rate=0.5 was only chosen once, but was the worst of the nine. the default model with just early stopping added, would have come second best in the grid measured on classification error, but fourth on mse, and seventh on logloss, whereas the âtunedâ model is top on all metrics, so we have more confidence in selecting it. as a final step, we ran the chosen model on the test data and got an error rate of \\(2.33\\%\\). this compares to \\(4.44\\%\\) with the default settings. $(\"pre\").each(function (index, item) { $(item).html(\"<code>\" + $(item).html() + \"</code>\"); }); hljs.highlightall(); "

    "body": " index search search back boosting in machine learning, boosting is an ensemble meta-algorithm for primarily reducing bias, variance in supervised learning. a weak learner is defined to be a classifier that is only slightly correlated with the true classification (it can label examples better than random guessing). in contrast, a strong learner is a classifier that is arbitrarily well-correlated with the true classification. before training each weak classifier, the data is sampled based on a distribution. this distribution initially assigns equal weight to each training example. after training, the weak classifier's accuracy on the training data is evaluated. the accuracy of the weak classifier determines its importance in the final model. higher accuracy leads to greater influence. re-weighting: after adding a weak learner, the data weights are adjusted, giving more weight to misclassified examples and reducing the weight of correctly classified ones. re-weighting helps subsequent weak learners to focus more on the examples that previous weak learners struggled with. regression trees boosting regression trees, often referred to as gradient boosting machines: what is the idea behind this procedure? given the current model, we fit a decision tree to the residuals \\(r_i\\) from the model rather than the outcome \\(y\\). each of these trees can be rather small, with just a few terminal nodes, determined by the parameter \\(d\\). by fitting small trees to the residuals, we slowly improve \\(\\hat{f}\\) in areas where it does not perform well. the shrinkage parameter \\(\\lambda\\) slows the process down even further. boosting has three tuning parameters: the number of trees \\(b\\): boosting can overfit if \\(b\\) is too large. the shrinkage parameter \\(\\lambda\\): this controls the rate at which boosting learns. the number \\(d\\) of splits in each tree, which controls the complexity of the ensemble. $(\"pre\").each(function (index, item) { $(item).html(\"<code>\" + $(item).html() + \"</code>\"); }); hljs.highlightall(); "

    "body": " index search search back interpretability importance of predictor variables we attempt to discuss the relevance of predictor variables in a statistical modeling technique called boosting. decision trees we define the following as a measure of relevance for each predictor variable \\(x_{\\mathcal{l}}\\): \\begin{align} i_{\\mathcal{l}}^2(t) = \\sum_{t = 1}^{j - 1} \\hat{i}^2_t i(v(t) = \\mathcal{l}) \\end{align} this equation calculates the relevance of each predictor variable based on the squared improvements in error risk within the internal nodes of the tree. let's split each part of the equation: the term \\(\\hat{i}^2_t\\) represents the squared improvement in error risk at node \\(t\\) when splitting on the \\(x_{\\mathcal{l}}\\) predictor variable. the variable \\(v(t)\\) indicates which predictor variable is used for the split at node \\(t\\). each improvement is weighted by the indicator function \\(i(v(t) = \\mathcal{l})\\), which checks if the splitting variable at node \\(t\\) is the predictor variable of interest \\(x_{\\mathcal{l}}\\). this weighting ensures that only the improvements related to the predictor variable \\(x_{\\mathcal{l}}\\) are considered in the calculation. we sum these improvements over the \\(j - 1\\) internal nodes on the tree, which are not terminal nodes. additive models this importance measure is easily generalized to additive tree expansions: \\begin{align} i_{\\mathcal{l}}^2 = \\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{m = 1}^{m} i_{\\mathcal{l}}^2(t_m) \\end{align} due to the stabilizing effect of averaging, this measure turns out to be more reliable than the measure computed only over one tree. partial dependence plots partial dependence functions, by isolating the effects of selected variables, provides an interpretable analysis of their impact on the model's predictions, overcoming the challenges of information overload in high-dimensional spaces. let's define the partial dependency of \\(f(x)\\) on \\(x_s\\), \\begin{align} f_s(x_s) = \\mathbb{e}_{x_c}[f(x_s, x_c)] \\end{align} where: \\(x_s\\) is the subset of variables we want to study. \\(x_c\\) is the complement set, that is the rest of variables. \\(e_{x_c}\\) denotes the expectation operator with respect to the variables in the complement set \\(x_c\\). it averages the model's output over the variables in the complement set. \\(f\\) represents the model. \\(f_s(x_s)\\) represents the relationship between the subset of variables \\(x_s\\) and the model's output. the average can be estimated as follows: \\begin{align} \\overline{f}_s(x_s) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n f(x_s, x_{i\\mathcal{c}}) \\end{align} we simply iterate over every data point on the training set, such that \\(x_{i\\mathcal{c}}\\) refers to the values of the variables in the complement set \\(x_c\\) for the \\(i\\)th data point. previously we measured the effects of \\(x_s\\) after accounting for the effects of the other variables \\(x_c\\) on \\(f(x)\\), they were not the effect of \\(x_s\\) on \\(f(x)\\) ignoring the effects of \\(x_c\\), that is given by: \\begin{align} \\tilde{f}_s(x_s) = \\mathbb{e}(f(x_s, x_c)|x_s) \\end{align} thus \\(\\tilde{f}_s(x_s) = \\overline{f}_s(x_s)\\) only if \\(x_s\\) and \\(x_c\\) are independent. example if we assume a purely additive effect, where the overall prediction is the sum of two components: \\begin{align} f(x) = h_1(x_s) + h_2(x_c) \\end{align} this implies that the effect of \\(x_s\\) on the prediction is independent of the other variables in \\(x_c\\). however if the prediction is defined as: \\begin{align} f(x) = h_1(x_s) \\cdot h_2(x_c) \\end{align} then this implies that the effect of \\(x_s\\) on the prediction is dependent on the values of the variables in \\(x_c\\). representation owing to the limitations of computer graphics, and human perception, the size of the subsets \\(x_s\\) must be small (\\(l \\approx 1, 2, 3\\)). $(\"pre\").each(function (index, item) { $(item).html(\"<code>\" + $(item).html() + \"</code>\"); }); hljs.highlightall(); "

    "body": " index search search back recurrent neural nets a recurrent neural network (rnn) is a class of neural networks that exploit the sequential nature of their input. such inputs could be text, speech, time series, and anything else where the occurrence of an element in the sequence is dependent on the elements that appeared before it. simplernn cells rnn cells incorporate this dependence by having a hidden state, or memory. the value of the hidden state is a function of the value of the hidden state at the previous time step and the value of the input at the current time step. \\begin{align} h_t = \\phi(h_{t-1}, x_t) \\end{align} where \\(h_t\\) and \\(h_{t-1}\\) are the values of the hidden states at the time steps \\(t\\) and \\(t-1\\) and \\(x_t\\) is the values of the input at time \\(t\\). note that the equation is recursive at time \\(t\\) the cell has an input \\(x_t\\) and an output \\(y_t\\). part of the output \\(y_t\\) (the hidden state \\(h_t\\)) is fed back into the cell for use at a later time step \\(t+1\\). on the previous image we show the behaviour of a single cell unrolled. notice that the weight matrices \\(u\\), \\(v\\), and \\(w\\) are shared across the steps. we can also describe the computations within an rnn in terms of equations: \\begin{align} h_t = tanh(wh_{t-1} + ux_t) \\end{align} \\begin{align} y_t = sofmax(vh_t) \\end{align} rnn topologies rnns can be arranged in many ways to solve specific problems. in the basic topology, all input sequences are of the same length and an output is produced at each time step. another example of a many to many rnn could be a machine translation network shown on the many-to-many topology. these take in a sequence and produces another sequence. for example, the input could be a sequence in english and the output could be the translation in spanish. other variants are the one-to-many network, an example of which could be an image captioning network, where the input is an image and the output a sequence of words. similarly, an example of a many-to-one network could be a network that does sentiment analysis of sentences, where the input is a sequence of words and the output is a positive or negative sentiment. vanishing and exploding gradients training the rnn involves backpropagation, where the gradient at each output depends not only on the current time step, but also on the previous ones, this process is called backpropagation through time (bptt). during backpropagation (shown by dotted lines), the gradients of the loss with respect to the parameters \\(u\\), \\(v\\), and \\(w\\) are computed at each time step and the parameters are updated with the sum of the gradients. the following equation shows the gradient of the loss with respect to \\(w\\): \\begin{align} \\frac{\\delta l}{\\delta w} = \\sum_t \\frac{\\delta l_t}{\\delta w} \\end{align} let us now look at what happens to the gradient of the loss at the last time step (\\(t=3\\)) \\begin{align} \\frac{\\delta l_3}{\\delta w} = \\frac{\\delta l_3}{\\delta y_3} \\frac{\\delta y_3}{\\delta h_2} \\frac{\\delta h_2}{\\delta_w} \\end{align} the previous equation is simply deriving by applying the chain rule, where: the loss function \\(l_3\\) is defined as a function of \\(y_3\\), then \\(y_3 = softmax(vh_2)\\) and finally \\(h_2 = tanh(wh_1 + ux_1)\\) the gradient of the hidden state \\(h_2\\) with respect to \\(w\\) can be further decomposed as the sum of the gradient of each hidden state with respect to the previous one. \\begin{align} \\frac{\\delta l_3}{\\delta w} = \\sum_{t=0}^2 \\frac{\\delta l_3}{\\delta y_3} \\frac{\\delta y_3}{\\delta h_2} \\frac{\\delta h_2}{\\delta h_t}\\frac{\\delta h_t}{\\delta_w} \\end{align} finally, each gradient of the hidden state with respect to the previous one can be further decomposed as the product of gradients of the current hidden state against the previous one. \\begin{align} \\frac{\\delta l_3}{\\delta w} = \\sum_{t=0}^2 \\frac{\\delta l_3}{\\delta y_3} \\frac{\\delta y_3}{\\delta h_2} \\left(\\prod_{j=t+1}^2 \\frac{\\delta h_j}{\\delta h_{j-1}}\\right)\\frac{\\delta h_t}{\\delta_w} \\end{align} for example for \\(t = 3\\): \\begin{align} \\frac{\\delta l_4}{\\delta w} = \\frac{\\delta l_4}{\\delta y_4} \\frac{\\delta y_4}{\\delta h_3} \\left(\\prod_{j=4}^2 \\frac{\\delta h_j}{\\delta h_{j-1}}\\right)\\frac{\\delta h_4}{\\delta_w} \\end{align} \\begin{align} \\frac{\\delta l_4}{\\delta w} = \\frac{\\delta l_4}{\\delta y_4} \\frac{\\delta y_4}{\\delta h_3} \\left(\\frac{\\delta h_4}{\\delta h_3}\\frac{\\delta h_3}{\\delta h_2}\\frac{\\delta h_2}{\\delta h_1}\\right)\\frac{\\delta h_4}{\\delta_w} \\end{align} on general: \\begin{align} \\frac{\\delta l_i}{\\delta w} = \\sum_{t=0}^i \\frac{\\delta l_i}{\\delta y_i} \\frac{\\delta y_i}{\\delta h_{i-1}} \\left(\\prod_{j=t+1}^i \\frac{\\delta h_j}{\\delta h_{j-1}}\\right)\\frac{\\delta h_i}{\\delta_w} \\end{align} consider the case where the individual gradients of a hidden state with respect to the previous one is less than one. as we backpropagate across multiple time steps, the product of gradients get smaller and smaller, leading to the problem of vanishing gradients. similarly, if the gradients are larger than one, the products get larger and larger, leading to the problem of exploding gradients. the effect of vanishing gradients is that the gradients from steps that are far away do not contribute anything to the learning process, so the rnn ends up not learning long range dependencies. while there are a few approaches to minimize the problem of vanishing gradients, such as: proper initialization of the \\(w\\) matrix using a relu instead of tanh layers pre-training the layers using unsupervised methods the most popular solution is to use the lstm or gru architectures. long short term memory â lstm the lstm is a variant of rnn that is capable of learning long term dependencies. the line across the top of the diagram is the cell state c, and represents the internal memory of the unit. the line across the bottom is the hidden state. also, \\(i\\), \\(f\\), and \\(o\\) are the input, forget, and output gates. the forget gate defines how much of the previous state \\(h_{t-1}\\) you want to allow to pass through. the input gate defines how much of the newly computed state for the current input \\(x_t\\) you want to let through. the output gate defines how much of the internal state you want to expose to the next layer. the internal hidden state \\(g\\) is computed based on the current input \\(x_t\\) and the previous hidden state \\(h_{t-1}\\). such that: \\begin{align} i = \\sigma(w_ih_{t-1} + u_ix_t) \\end{align} \\begin{align} f = \\sigma(w_fh_{t-1} + u_fx_t)

\\end{align} \\begin{align} h_t = tanh(c_t) \\otimes o \\end{align} one thing to realize is that an lstm is a drop-in replacement for a simplernn on the recurrent neural network. gated recurrent unit â gru this type of cell has two gates, an update gate \\(z\\), and a reset gate \\(r\\). the update gate defines how much previous memory to keep around. the reset gate defines how to combine the new input with the previous memory. the following equations define the gating mechanism in a gru: \\begin{align} z = \\sigma(w_zh_{t-1} + u_z x_t) \\end{align} \\begin{align} r = \\sigma(w_rh_{t-1} + u_r x_t) \\end{align} \\begin{align} c_t = tanh(w_c(h_{t-1} \\otimes r) + u_cx_t) \\end{align} \\begin{align} h_t = (z \\otimes c) \\oplus ((1 - z) \\otimes h_{t-1}) \\end{align} gru and lstm have comparable performance, while grus are faster to train and need less data to generalize in situations where there is enough data, an lstm's greater expressive power may lead to better results.

    "title": "Autoencoders",
    "body": " index search search back autoencoders autoencoders an autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network used to learn efficient codings of unlabeled data (unsupervised learning). an autoencoder learns two functions: an encoding function that transforms the input data a decoding function that recreates the input data from the encoded representation. the autoencoder learns dense representations (encoding) for a set of data. we can force the network to learn useful features adding different types of constraints, for example: defining the dense representation such that is has a lower dimensionality than the input data. adding noise to the input data (denoising autoencoders). the number of neurons in the output layer must be equal to the number of inputs. the outputs are often called the reconstructions because the cost function contains a reconstruction loss that penalizes the model when the reconstructions are different from the inputs. undercomplete autoencoder: the internal representation has a lower dimensionality than the input data. overcomplete autoencoder: the internal representation has a higher dimensionality than the input data. stacked autoencoders stacked autoencoders are said to be autoencoders that have multiple hidden layers. tying weights an autoencoder with tied weights has decoder weights that are the transpose of the encoder weights this reduces the number of parameters of the model, thus speeds up training and limits the risk of overfitting. convolutional autoencoders used with image data. the encoder is a regular cnn composed of convolutional layers and pooling layers. it reduces the spatial dimensionality of the inputs (i.e., height and width) while increasing the depth (i.e., the number of feature maps). the decoder must do the reverse (upscale the image and reduce its depth back to the original dimensions). recurrent autoencoders used with sequential data. the encoder is typically a sequence-to-vector rnn, which compresses the input sequence down to a single vector. the decoder is a vector-to-sequence rnn that does the reverse denoising autoencoders we want to add noise to the input data, and then train the network to be able to recover the original noise-free inputs. the noise can be pure gaussian noise added to the inputs, or it can be randomly switched-off inputs, just like in dropout. sparse autoencoders a sparse autoencoder is an autoencoder whose training criterion involves a sparsity penalty. in most cases, we would construct our loss function by penalizing activations of hidden layers so that only a few nodes are encouraged to activate when a single sample is fed into the network. variational autoencoders they are probabilistic autoencoders as well as generative models. instead of directly producing a coding for a given input, the encoder produces a mean coding \\(\\mu\\) and a standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\). the actual coding is then sampled randomly from a gaussian distribution with mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\). after that the decoder decodes the sampled coding normally. generative adversarial networks gans are composed of two neural networks: a generator that tries to generate data that looks similar to the training data a discriminator that tries to tell real data from fake data. takes either a fake image from the generator or a real image from the training set as input, and must guess whether the input image is fake or real. each training iteration is divided into two phases: we train the discriminator. a batch of data where half are real real images and the other half are fake images produced by the generator. the labels are set to \\(0\\) for fake images and \\(1\\) for real images, and the discriminator is trained on this labeled batch for one step. backpropagation only optimizes the weights of the discriminator. we train the generator: we only add fake images to the data, and all the labels are set to \\(1\\) (real). we want the generator to produce images that the discriminator will believe to be real. backpropagation only affects the weights of the generator. the generator and the discriminator compete against each other during training. the difficulties of traning gans it has been demonstrated that a gan can only reach a single nash equilibrium (we assume the training process to be finished): thatâs when the generator produces perfectly realistic images, and the discriminator is forced to guess (\\(50\\%\\) real, \\(50\\%\\) fake). nothing guarantees that the equilibrium will ever be reached. the biggest difficulty is called mode collapse: this is when the generatorâs outputs gradually become less diverse. such that the generator gets very good at generating data of a concrete kind, good enough to fool the discriminator, however it progressively start representing data of another kind and then forgets about the previous class of data. moreover, because the generator and the discriminator are constantly pushing against each other, their parameters may end up oscillating and becoming unstable. and since many factors affect these complex dynamics, gans are very sensitive to the hyperparameters. there are some techniques that aim to avoid this behaviour like: experience replay and mini-batch discrimination. experience replay: stores images on a buffer and the discriminator uses the images on this buffer as input for fake images. old images are then progressively replaces by newer images. mini-batch discrimination: it measures how similar are images on the batch, the discriminator uses this statistic to decide whether to reject the whole batch or not. deep convolutional gans these are gans based on deeper convolutional nets for larger images. progressive growing of gans it begins by generating images at low resolution, such as \\(4 \\times 4\\) pixels. the model is first trained on low-resolution images. once training stabilizes at this resolution, additional layers are added to the generator and discriminator to allow for the generation of higher-resolution images. after adding new layers, there is usually a transition phase where the model is trained on a mixture of images at the old and new resolutions. this gradual transition allows the model to adapt to the increased resolution without destabilizing the training process. once the training stabilizes at the new resolution, the transition phase ends, and the model continues to train exclusively on images at the higher resolution. increasing the resolution progressively allows the model to learn to capture both global and local features of the images more effectively. style gans what sets stylegans apart is the introduction of \"style\" into the generation process. in traditional gans, the generator takes random noise as input and directly generates images. in stylegans, the generator learns to separate the \"content\" of the image (e.g., facial features) from the \"style\" (e.g., lighting, color, texture). this allows for more fine-grained control over the generated images. the stylegan generator and discriminator models are trained using the progressive growing gan training method. stylegans consist of two main components: a mapping network and a synthesis network. the mapping network takes as input a latent vector (random noise) and maps it to an intermediate latent space, which controls the style of the generated image. the synthesis network then takes the intermediate latent representation and generates the final image.

    "title": "Boltzmann Based Networks",
    "body": " index search search back boltzmann based networks boltzmann machines they are fully connected artificial neural networks, but they are based on stochastic neurons. the working of boltzmann machine is mainly inspired by the boltzmann distribution which says that the current state of the system depends on the energy of the system and the temperature at which it is currently operating. these neurons output \\(1\\) with some probability, given by the following equation: \\begin{align} p(s_i^{\\text{next step}} = 1) \\sigma\\left(\\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^n w_{i,j}s_j + b_i}{t}\\right) \\end{align} where: \\(s_j\\) is the \\(j\\)th neuron's state (\\(0\\) or \\(1\\)). \\(w_{i,j}\\) is the connection weight between the \\(i\\)th and \\(j\\)th neurons. note that \\(w_{i,i}\\) = 0. \\(b_i\\) is the ith neuronâs bias term. \\(n\\) is the number of neurons in the network. \\(t\\) is a number called the networkâs temperature; the higher the temperature, the more random the output. \\(\\sigma\\) is the logistic function. hence to implement these as neural networks, we use the energy models. the energy term was equivalent to the deviation from the actual answer. the higher the energy, the more the deviation. it has been thus important to train the model until it reaches a low-energy point. the nodes in boltzmann machines are simply categorized as visible and hidden nodes. the visible nodes take in the input. the same nodes which take in the input will return back the reconstructed input as the output. the energy function of the boltzmann machine is defined as follows: \\begin{aligned} e(v, h) = - \\sum_{i} v_ib_i - \\sum_k h_kb_k - \\sum_{i, j}v_iv_jw_{i,j} \\sum_{i,k}v_ih_kw_{i, k} - \\sum_{k,l}h_kh_kw_{k,l} \\end{aligned} where \\(v\\) are the visible units, \\(h\\) as the hidden units \\(b\\) is the bias and \\(w_{i, j}\\) are the weights between units \\(i\\) and \\(j\\). the probability of a joint configuration over both the visible unit and the hidden unit is as follows: \\begin{aligned} p(v,h) = \\frac{e^{-e(v,h)}}{\\sum_{m, n} e^{-e(m, n)}} \\end{aligned} and, for example, the probability distribution of visible units is obtained by marginalizing out hidden units: \\begin{aligned} p(v) = \\frac{\\sum_h e^{-e(v,h)}}{\\sum_{m, n} e^{-e(m, n)}} \\end{aligned} this can now be utilized to sample visible units. training a boltzmann machine means finding the parameters that will make the network approximate the training setâs probability distribution. so we have to obtain the parameters tha maximize the likelihood of the observed data. the traning algorithm runs as described: obtain the log likelihood function of visible units, by marginalizing the hidden units: \\begin{align} l(v|w) = \\log p(v|w) = \\log \\sum_h e^{-e_{v, h}} - \\log \\sum_{m, n} e^{-e_{m, n}} \\end{align} take the derivative of the log likelihood function as a function of \\(w\\): \\begin{align} \\frac{\\delta l(v|w)}{\\delta w} = \\frac{\\delta \\log \\sum_h e^{-e_{v, h}}}{\\delta \\sum_h e^{-e_{v, h}}} \\cdot \\frac{\\delta \\sum_h e^{-e_{v, h}}}{\\delta w} - \\frac{\\delta \\log \\sum_h e^{-e_{v, h}}}{\\delta \\sum_{m,n} e^{-e_{m, n}}} \\cdot \\frac{\\delta \\sum_Ì£{m,n} e^{-e_{m, n}}}{\\delta w} \\end{align} \\begin{align} = \\frac{1}{\\sum_h e^{-e_{v, h}}} \\cdot \\sum_h \\frac{\\delta e^{-e_{v,h}}}{\\delta w} - \\frac{1}{\\sum_{m,n} e^{-e_{m, n}}} \\cdot \\sum_{m,n} \\frac{\\delta e^{-e_{m,m}}}{\\delta w} \\end{align} \\begin{align} = \\frac{1}{\\sum_h e^{-e_{v, h}}} \\cdot \\sum_h -e^{-e_{v,h}} \\frac{\\delta e_{v,h}}{\\delta w} - \\frac{1}{\\sum_{m,n} e^{-e_{m, n}}} \\cdot \\sum_{m,n} -e^{e_{m,m}} \\frac{\\delta e_{m,m}}{\\delta w} \\end{align} \\begin{align} = -\\sum_h \\frac{e^{-e_{v,h}}}{\\sum_h e^{-e_{v, h}}} \\frac{\\delta e_{v,h}}{\\delta w} + \\sum_{m,n} \\frac{e^{e_{m,m}}}{\\sum_{m,n} e^{-e_{m, n}}} \\frac{\\delta e_{m,m}}{\\delta w} \\end{align} we know that: \\begin{align} p(h|v) = \\frac{p(v, h)}{p(v)} = \\frac{\\frac{e^{-e_{v, h}}}{\\sum_{m,n} e^{-e_{m, n}}}}{\\frac{\\sum_h e^{-e_{v, h}}}{\\sum_{m,n} e^{-e_{m, n}}}} \\end{align} by removing both \\(\\sum_{m,n} e^{-e_{m, n}}\\), we obtain: \\begin{align} = \\frac{e^{-e_{v, h}}}{\\sum_h e^{-e_{v, h}}} \\end{align} such that: \\begin{align} = -\\sum_h p(h|v) \\frac{\\delta e_{v,h}}{\\delta w} + \\sum_{m,n} p(m,n) \\frac{\\delta e_{m,m}}{\\delta w} \\end{align} and by de definition of the expected value \\(\\mathbb{e}(x) = \\sum_x x p(x)\\): \\begin{align} = - \\mathbb{e}_{p(h|v)}[\\frac{\\delta e_{v,h}}{\\delta w}] + \\mathbb{e}_Ì£{p(m,n)}[\\frac{\\delta e_{m,m}}{\\delta w}] \\end{align} computing these expectations is in general an intractable problem. he general approach for solving this problem is to use markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) to approximate these quantities: \\begin{align} \\frac{\\delta l(v|w)}{\\delta w} = - <s_i, s_j>_{p(h_{data}|v_{data})} + <s_i, s_j>_{p(h_{model}|v_{model})} \\end{align} here \\(<\\cdot, \\cdot>\\) denotes the expectation. restricted boltzmann machines an rbm is a boltzmann machine that only has connections between visible and hidden units. the energy function of the rbm is defined as follows: \\begin{align} e(v, h) = - \\sum_i v_ib_i - \\sum_k h_kb_k - \\sum_{i,k} v_i h_k w_{i,k} \\end{align} contrastive divergence this is a very efficient training algorithm for boltzmann machines. here is how it works: for each training instance \\(x\\), the algorithm starts by feeding it to the network by setting the state of the visible units to \\(x_1, \\cdots, x_n\\). compute the state of the hidden units by applying the output formula for a hidden neuron (see ), which gives us the vector \\(h\\), where \\(h_i\\) is the output of the ith neuron. next you compute the state of the visible units, by applying the same stochastic equation, which gives you vector \\(x'\\). once again you compute the state of the hidden units, which gives you a vector \\(h'\\). now you can update each connection weight by applying: \\begin{align} w_{i, j} = w_{i, j} + \\eta (xh^t - x'h'^t) \\end{align} the great benefit of this algorithm is that it does not require waiting for the network to reach thermal equilibrium. deep belief nets a deep belief net is an rbm where several layers of rbms can be stacked. such that the hidden units of the first-level rbm serve as the visible units for the second-layer rbm. you can train dbns one layer at a time using contrastive divergence, starting with the lower layers. their lower layers learn low-level features in the input data, while higher layers learn high-level features. thus it learns information in a hierarchical way. just like rbms, dbns are fundamentally unsupervised, but you can also train them in a semi-supervised manner by adding some visible units to represent the labels. the following describes the training process: rbm 1 is trained without supervision. rbm 2 is trained with rbm 1âs hidden units as inputs without supervision rbm 3 is trained using rbm 2âs hidden units as inputs, as well as extra visible units used to represent the target labels one advantage of this semisupervised approach is that you don't need much labeled training data. dbns can also work in reverse. if you activate one of the label units, the signal will propagate up to the hidden units of rbm 3, then down to rbm 2, and then rbm 1, and a new instance will be output by the visible units of rbm 1. this generative capability of dbns is quite powerful. for example, it has been used to automatically generate captions for images, and vice versa: first a dbn is trained (without supervision) to learn features in images, and another dbn is trained (again without supervision) to learn features in sets of captions (e.g., \"car\" often comes with \"automobile\"). then an rbm is stacked on top of both dbns and trained with a set of images along with their captions; it learns to associate high-level features in images with high-level features in captions. next, if you feed the image dbn an image of a car, the signal will propagate through the network, up to the top-level rbm, and back down to the bottom of the caption dbn, producing a caption. due to the stochastic nature of rbms and dbns, the caption will keep changing randomly a dbn, however, suffers from the following problems: inference in dbns is a problem because of the \"explaining away\" effect a dbn can only use greedy retraining and no joint optimization over all layers deep boltzmann machines the distinction between dbm and dbn from the previous section is that dbm information flows on bidirectional connections in the bottom layers. you can also train a dbm using contrastive divergence. $(\"pre\").each(function (index, item) { $(item).html(\"<code>\" + $(item).html() + \"</code>\"); }); hljs.highlightall(); "

    "body": " index search search back rendering webgl rendering pipeline webgl runs on the gpu on your computer. as such, you need to provide code that runs on that gpu. this code is comprised by two functions called vertex shader and fragment shader, written in a very strictly-typed c/c++-like language called glsl, gl shader language. together, they are called a program. a vertex shader's job is to compute vertex attributes, it outputs values that can be used to rasterize various kinds of primitives, including points, lines, and triangles. a fragment shader's job is to compute a color for each pixel of the primitive currently being drawn. let's examine what webgl's rendering pipeline. the following is a diagram of a simplified version of webgl's rendering pipeline: vertex buffer objects (vbos) vbos contain the data that is used to describe the geometry to be rendered. vertex coordinates, are usually stored and processed in webgl as vbos. index buffer objects (ibos) ibos contain information about the relationship of the vertices. it uses the index of each vertex in the vertex buffer as a value. vertex shader the vertex shader is called on each vertex. the shader manipulates per-vertex data. fragment shader each surface element (pixel) is called a fragment. the main goal of the fragment shader is to calculate the color of individual pixels. framebuffer the framebuffer is a two-dimensional buffer contains the fragments that have been processed by the fragment shader. attributes attributes are input variables that are used in the vertex shader. for example, you may put three dimensional \\(32\\)-bit vectors in a buffer. you would tell a particular attribute which buffer to pull the vectors out of, what type of data it should pull out (\\(3\\)-component, \\(32\\)-bit floating point numbers), what offset in the buffer the positions start at, and how many bytes to get from one position to the next. uniform uniforms are input variables that are available to both the vertex shader and the fragment shader. unlike attributes, uniforms are constant during a rendering cycle. textures textures are arrays of data that can be accessed in your shader program. image data is the most common thing to put in a texture. varyings varyings are used to pass data from the vertex shader to the fragment shader. the values set on a varying by a vertex shader will be interpolated while executing the fragment shader. rendering in webgl there are two data types that are fundamental: vertices and indices. vertices are the points that define the corners of 3d objects. each vertex is represented by three floating-point numbers that correspond to the x, y, and z coordinates of the vertex. indices are numeric labels for the vertices in a given 3d scene. indices allow us to tell webgl how to connect vertices in order to produce a surface. both vertices and indices are stored on a javascript array and passed to webgl's rendering pipeline. defining a geometry using javascript arrays as you can see from the preceding illustration, we have placed the coordinates sequentially in the vertex array and then indicated how these coordinates are used to draw the trapezoid in the index array. triangles in the index array are usually, but not necessarily, defined in counter-clockwise order. it's important to pick one approach and keep it consistent because programs may use the clockwise/counter-clockwise order to determine whether a face is facing forward or backward for culling and rendering purposes. in computer graphics, back-face culling determines whether a polygon of a graphical object is visible. creating webgl buffers let's render a square. we define the vertices, and create the respective buffer. these vertices are defined in clipspace coordinates, because webgl only deals with clipspace coordinates. clipspace coordinates always go from \\(-1\\) to \\(+1\\). const vertices = [ -0.5, 0.5, 0, -0.5, -0.5, 0, 0.5, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 0.5, 0 ]; const positionbuffer = gl.createbuffer(); now, when positionbuffer is made the currently-bound webgl buffer any subsequent buffer operation will be executed on this buffer until it is unbound, or another buffer is made the current one. gl.bindbuffer(gl.array_buffer, positionbuffer); the first parameter is the type of buffer we are creating: gl.array_buffer: vertex data gl.element_array_buffer: index data once we have bound a buffer, we need to pass along its contents. gl.bufferdata(gl.array_buffer, new float32array(vertices), gl.static_draw); the last argument is the type, which is a performance hint for webgl. the accepted values for type are as follows: static_draw: data in the buffer will not be changed (specified once and used many times) dynamic_draw: data will be changed frequently (specified many times and used many times) stream_draw: data will change on every rendering cycle (specified once and used once) webgl requires javascript typed array so that the buffer data can be processed in its native binary form with the objective of speeding up geometryprocessing performance. the typed arrays used by webgl include int8array, uint8array, int16array, uint16array, int32array, uint32array, float32array, and float64array. it's important to note that vertex coordinates can be float, but indices are always integers. finally, it is a good practice to unbind the buffer. gl.bindbuffer(gl.array_buffer, null); all this same process applies for the index buffer. associating attributes to vbos once we have created the vbos, we need to associate these buffers to vertex shader attributes. each vertex shader attribute will refer to one and only one buffer. we can achieve this by following these steps: bind a vbo gl.bindbuffer(gl.array_buffer, mybuffer); point an attribute to the currently-bound vbo gl.vertexattribpointer(index, size, type, normalize, stride, offset); index: attribute's index that we are bounding the currently-bound buffer to (i.e. avertexposition) size: number of values per vertex that are stored in the currently-bound buffer. type: data type of the values stored in the current buffer (fixed, byte, unsigned_byte, float, short, unsigned_short) normalize: beyond scope (set to false) stride: if stride is 0, then we are indicating that elements are stored sequentially in the buffer. offset: the position in the buffer from which we will start reading values for the corresponding attribute. generally \\(0\\). enable the attribute gl.enablevertexattribarray(positionattributelocation); unbind gl.bindbuffer(gl.array_buffer, null); rendering drawing functions the drawarrays and drawelements functions are used for writing to the framebuffer. drawarrays uses vertex data in the order in which it is defined in the buffer to create the geometry. in contrast, drawelements uses indices to access the vertex data buffers and create the geometry. both drawarrays and drawelements will only use enabled arrays. using drawarrays we will call drawarrays when information about indices is not available. in most cases, drawarrays is used when the geometry is simple enough that defining indices is overkill. when we want to render a triangle or a rectangle. in that case, webgl will create the geometry in the order in which the vertex coordinates are defined in the vbo. if you have contiguous triangles (as we did in the trapezoid example), you will have to repeat these coordinates in the vbo. if you need to repeat many vertices to create the geometry, drawarrays is not the optimal method. the more vertex data you duplicate, the more calls you will have on the vertex shader, one per vertex. the signature for drawarrays is as follows: gl.drawarrays(mode, first, count) where: mode: the type of primitive that we are going to render: gl.points, gl.line_strip, gl.line_loop, gl.lines, gl.triangle_strip, gl.triangle_fan, and gl.triangles. first: the starting element in the enabled arrays. count: the number of elements rendered. using drawelements drawelements allows us to use the ibo to tell webgl how to render the geometry. therefore, vertices are only processed once, and can be used as many times as they are defined in the ibo. this feature reduces both the memory and processing required on the gpu. when we use drawelements, we need at least two buffers: a vbo and an ibo. as the vertex shader gets executed on each vertex, the rendering pipeline assembles the geometry into triangles using the ibo. the signature for drawelements is as follows: gl.drawelements(mode, count, type, offset) where: mode: the type of primitive that we are going to render: gl.points, gl.line_strip, gl.line_loop, gl.lines, gl.triangle_strip, gl.triangle_fan, and gl.triangles. count: the number of elements rendered. type: the type of the values in indices: unsigned_byte or unsigned_short. offset: which element in the buffer will be the starting point for rendering. rendering a square we first, compile each shader as follows: /** * compiles the vertex or fragment shader */ export const compileshader = ( gl: webgl2renderingcontext, type: program_type, source: string ) => { let shader; if (type === program_type.vertex) { shader = gl.createshader(gl.vertex_shader); } else { shader = gl.createshader(gl.fragment_shader); } if (!shader) return; gl.shadersource(shader, source); gl.compileshader(shader); if (!gl.getshaderparameter(shader, gl.compile_status)) { console.error(gl.getshaderinfolog(shader)); return null; } return shader; }; we use this utility function to create the program: /** * creates a program that is made up of a vertex shader and a fragment shader */ export const createprogram = ( gl: webgl2renderingcontext, vertexshadersource: string, fragmentshadersource: string ) => { // obtain the shaders const vertexshader = compileshader( gl, program_type.vertex, vertexshadersource ); const fragmentshader = compileshader( gl, program_type.fragment, fragmentshadersource ); // create a program const program = gl.createprogram(); if (!program || !vertexshader || !fragmentshader) { throw \"could no create program\"; } // attach the shaders to this program gl.attachshader(program, vertexshader); gl.attachshader(program, fragmentshader); gl.linkprogram(program); if (!gl.getprogramparameter(program, gl.link_status)) { throw \"could not initialize shaders\"; } // use this program instance gl.useprogram(program); return program; }; once the program has been created, we populate our buffers: /** draws square on center of clipspace x in (-1, 1), y in (-1, 1) * 0->(-0.5, 0.5) 3->(0.5, 0.5) * +-------------+ * | / | * | / | * | / | * | / | * +-------------+ * 1->(-0.5, -0.5) 2->(0.5, -0.5) * */ // define vertices for position on space: the depth (z) is not important for now const vertices = [-0.5, 0.5, 0, -0.5, -0.5, 0, 0.5, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 0.5, 0]; // define indices for identifying triangles that make up the geometry // using counter-clock wise order // first triangle is made up from the vertices 0, 1, and 2, the second triangle // is made up of vertices 1, 2 and 3 indices = [0, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3]; // set up vbo verticesbuffer = gl.createbuffer(); gl.bindbuffer(gl.array_buffer, verticesbuffer); gl.bufferdata(gl.array_buffer, new float32array(vertices), gl.static_draw); // set up ibo indicesbuffer = gl.createbuffer(); gl.bindbuffer(gl.element_array_buffer, indicesbuffer); gl.bufferdata( gl.element_array_buffer, new uint16array(indices), gl.static_draw ); // unbind buffers gl.bindbuffer(gl.array_buffer, null); gl.bindbuffer(gl.element_array_buffer, null); now, in order to draw, we bind our buffers again and the we bind and enable the attributes: // clear the scene gl.clear(gl.color_buffer_bit | gl.depth_buffer_bit); gl.viewport(0, 0, gl.canvas.width, gl.canvas.height); // bind the vertex buffer with an attribute gl.bindbuffer(gl.array_buffer, verticesbuffer); // obtain attribute instance const vertexpositionattr = gl.getattriblocation(program, \"avertexposition\"); // bind attibute to buffer and set some metadata gl.vertexattribpointer(vertexpositionattr, 3, gl.float, false, 0, 0); // enable attribute gl.enablevertexattribarray(vertexpositionattr); // bind ibo gl.bindbuffer(gl.element_array_buffer, indicesbuffer); // draw to the scene using triangle primitives gl.drawelements(gl.triangles, indices.length, gl.unsigned_short, 0); // unbind buffers gl.bindbuffer(gl.array_buffer, null); gl.bindbuffer(gl.element_array_buffer, null); vertex array objects vertex array objects (vaos) allow you to store all of the vertex/index binding information for a set of buffers in a single, easy to manage object. this is an important feature that should always be used, since it significantly reduces rendering times. when not using vaos, all attributes data is in global webgl state, which means that calling functions such as gl.vertexattribpointer, gl.enablevertexattribarray, and gl.bindbuffer(gl.element_array_buffer, buffer) manipulates the global state. this leads to performance loss, because before any draw call, we would need to set up all vertex attributes and set the element_array_buffer where indexed data is being used. with vaos, we would set up all attributes during our application's initialization and simply bind the data at render, yielding much better performance. so how would we use a vao. there are two steps that change, firstly when we populate our data we create a vao object alongside our vbo and ibo. and we also create create and enable here our vertex attributes. // define vertices for position on space: the depth (z) is not important for now const vertices = [-0.5, 0.5, 0, -0.5, -0.5, 0, 0.5, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 0.5, 0]; // define indices for identifying triangles that make up the geometry // using counter-clock wise order // first triangle is made up from the vertices 0, 1, and 2, the second triangle // is made up of vertices 1, 2 and 3 indices = [0, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3]; // set up vao vao = gl.createvertexarray(); gl.bindvertexarray(vao); // set up vbo (used inside vao) const verticesbuffer = gl.createbuffer(); gl.bindbuffer(gl.array_buffer, verticesbuffer); gl.bufferdata(gl.array_buffer, new float32array(vertices), gl.static_draw); // tell vao how to use the current bound buffer (vertices buffer!) // refer to 01_square.html and see how now the definition of how the data should // be retrived is done now on initialization instead of on render. // obtain attribute instance const vertexpositionattr = gl.getattriblocation(program, \"avertexposition\"); gl.enablevertexattribarray(vertexpositionattr); gl.vertexattribpointer(vertexpositionattr, 3, gl.float, false, 0, 0); // set up ibo indicesbuffer = gl.createbuffer(); gl.bindbuffer(gl.element_array_buffer, indicesbuffer); gl.bufferdata( gl.element_array_buffer, new uint16array(indices), gl.static_draw ); // unbind buffers gl.bindvertexarray(null); gl.bindbuffer(gl.array_buffer, null); gl.bindbuffer(gl.element_array_buffer, null); and, in order to draw we simply bind our vao and our ibo to be used with drawelements. // clear the scene gl.clear(gl.color_buffer_bit | gl.depth_buffer_bit); gl.viewport(0, 0, gl.canvas.width, gl.canvas.height); // bind vao gl.bindvertexarray(vao); // bind ibo gl.bindbuffer(gl.element_array_buffer, indicesbuffer); // draw to the scene using triangle primitives gl.drawelements(gl.triangles, indices.length, gl.unsigned_short, 0); // unbind buffers gl.bindvertexarray(null); gl.bindbuffer(gl.element_array_buffer, null); drawelements modes triangles: webgl will use the first three indices defined in your ibo to construct the first triangle, the next three to construct the second triangle, and so on. lines: will instruct webgl to take each consecutive pair of indices defined in the ibo and draw lines by taking the coordinates of the corresponding vertices. points: webgl will not generate surfaces. instead, it will render the vertices that we had defined using the index array. lines_loop: draws a closed loop connecting the vertices defined in the ibo to the next one. line_strip: is similar to line_loop. the difference is that webgl does not connect the last vertex to the first one. triangle_strip: draws connected triangles. every vertex is specified after the first three. triangle_fan: fan creates triangles in a similar way to triangle_strip. however, the first vertex defined in the ibo is taken as the origin of the fan (the only shared vertex among consecutive triangles). webgl as a state machine: buffer manipulation when dealing with buffers for the getparameter, getbufferparameter, and isbuffer functions, new information about the state of the rendering pipeline becomes available to us. getparameter(parameter), we use parameter to retrieve a reference to the currently-bound vbo (parameter=array_buffer_binding) or to retrieve a reference to the currently-bound ibo (parameter=element_array_buffer_bindings). we can also query the size and the usage of the currently-bound vbo and ibo using getbufferparameter(type, parameter), where type can have the following values: array_buffer: to refer to the currently-bound vbo element_array_buffer: to refer to the currently-bound ibo and parameter can have the following values: buffer_size: returns the size of the requested buffer buffer_usage: returns the usage of the requested buffer finally, isbuffer(object) will return true if the object is a webgl buffer, or false with an error when the buffer is invalid. $(\"pre\").each(function (index, item) { $(item).html(\"<code>\" + $(item).html() + \"</code>\");

    "body": " index search search back getting started webgl is a 3d graphics library that enables modern web browsers to render 3d scenes in a standard and efficient manner. software and hardware based rendering the first distinction we should make is whether we are using any special graphics hardware. on one hand, we can talk about software-based rendering for cases where all required calculations to render 3d scenes are performed using the computer's central processing unit (cpu). on the other hand, as is the case with webgl, we use the term hardware-based rendering for scenarios where there is a gpu performing 3d graphics computations. hardware-based rendering is much more efficient than software-based rendering, because the former involves dedicated hardware handling the necessary operations. server and client based rendering the second distinction to make is whether the rendering process is happening locally or remotely. when the image that needs to be rendered is too complex, the render will most likely occur remotely. we call this server-based rendering. the opposite of this approach takes place when rendering occurs locally. we call this client-based rendering. webgl offers a client-based rendering approach: the processing required to obtain an image is all performed locally using the client's graphics hardware. webgl presents several advantages javascript programming automatic memory management pervasiveness performance zero compilation retained and immediate mode rendering in th retained-mode the graphics library maintains a scene model in memory, to change what is rendered, the application issues a command to update the scene. in the inmediate-mode each time a new frame is drawn the application issues all drawing commands required to describe the entire scene. retained-mode rendering can be simpler to use, because the api does more of the work for you, such as initialization, state maintenance, and cleanup. however, it is often less flexible since the api forces its own particular scene model; it can also have higher memory prerequisites. immediate-mode rendering, on the other hand, as offered with webgl, is much more flexible and can implement targeted optimizations. elements in a webgl application some of these common elements include: canvas: the placeholder where our scene is rendered. objects: the 3d entities that make up the scene. lights camera accessing the webgl context a webgl context is an object through which we can access webgl functions and attributes. <script type=\"text/javascript\"> 'use strict'; function init() { const canvas = document.getelementbyid('webgl-canvas'); // ensure we have a canvas if (!canvas) { console.error('sorry! no html5 canvas was found on this page'); return; } const gl = canvas.getcontext('webgl2'); } // call init once the document has loaded window.onload = init; </script> a webgl context can be understood as a state machine: once you modify attributes, the modifications persist until later modifications. for example: const color = gl.getparameter(gl.color_clear_value); here gl.color_clear_value is one of the webgl context attributes. $(\"pre\").each(function (index, item) { $(item).html(\"<code>\" + $(item).html() + \"</code>\"); }); hljs.highlightall(); "

    "title": "Machine Language",
    "body": " index search search back machine language overview hardware elements a machine language can be viewed as an agreed-upon formalism designed to manipulate a memory using a processor and a set of registers. memory: refers to the collection of hardware devices that store data and instructions. it is a continuous sequence of cells, also referred to as locations or memory registers, each having a unique address. processor: the processor, central processing unit, or cpu, is a device capable of performing a fixed set of primitive operations: arithmetic, locical operation, memory access operations and control (branching) operations. it consists of an alu, a set of registers, and gate logic that enables it to parse and execute binary instructions. registers: moving data from the memory to the processor is relatively slow. for this reason, processors are normally equipped with several onboard registers inside the processor's chip that serves as high-speed local memory. these registers fall into two categories: data registers, which hold data values, and address registers, which hold values that can be interpreted either as data values or as memory addresses. languages machine language programs can be written in two ways: binary and symbolic. symbolic machine languages are called assembly languages, and the programs that translate them into binary code are called assemblers. the syntax of an assembly language is tightly related to the low-level details of the target hardware: the available alu operations, number and type of registers, memory size, and so on. instructions arithmetic and logical operations: every machine language features instructions for performing basic arithmetic operations: memory access: every machine language features means for accessing and manipulating selected memory locations. this is typically done using an address register, \\(a\\). for example, suppose we wish to set memory location \\(17\\) to the value \\(1\\). we can decide to do so using the two instructions load a,17 followed by load m,1, where, by convention, \\(m\\) stands for the memory register selected by \\(a\\). flow control: to facilitate branching actions, machine languages feature several variants of conditional and unconditional goto instructions, as well as label declaration statements that mark the goto destinations (see figure 4.1). symbols: code that uses symbolic references is much easier to write, debug and maintain. also low-level code that mentions no physical addresses is said to be relocatable. the hack machine language background hack is a \\(16\\)-bit computer, meaning that the cpu and the memory units are designed to process, move, and store, chunks of \\(16\\)-bit values. memory: the hack platform uses two distinct memory units: a data memory and an instruction memory. the data memory (which we also call ram) is a read/write device. so hack instructions can read data from, and write data to, selected ram registers. the current data register is referred as \\(m\\). the instruction memory (which we also call rom) is a read-only device, and programs are loaded into it. the current instruction register is referred as the current instruction. registers: hack instructions are designed to manipulate three \\(16\\)-bit registers: a data register, denoted d, an address register, denoted a, and a selected data memory register, denoted m. addresing: the hack instruction @xxx sets the a register to the value xxx. this has two side effects: it makes the ram register whose address is xxx the selected memory register it makes the value of the rom register whose address is xxx the selected instruction which action to pursue is determined by the subsequent hack instruction. branching: for example jo jump to instruction number \\(29\\) we would use these two instructions: @29, 0;jmp. the first instruction selects the rom[29] register and the second one realizes an unconditional jump to execute said instruction. the hack language also features conditional branching. variables: the xxx in the hack instruction @xxx can be either a constant or a symbol. the use of symbols endows hack assembly programs with the ability to use variables. for example let x = 17 translates to: @17 d=a @x which basically selects the ram register whose address is the value that is bound to the symbol x, and set this register to \\(17\\). we assume that there is an agent who knows how to bind the symbols to addresses (the assembler). on the following figure the show an example of the tranlation of pseudocode to our assembly language: the hack language specification the hack machine language consists of two instructions, specified in figure 4.5. the a-instruction the a-instruction sets the a register to some \\(15\\)-bit value. the binary version consists of two fields: an operation code (op-code), which is \\(0\\), followed by fifteen bits that code a nonnegative binary number. the a-instruction is used for three different purposes: it's the only way to enter a constant into the computer. sets the stage for a subsequent c-instruction that manipulates a selected ram register. sets the stage for a subsequent c-instruction that specifies a jump. the c-instruction the c-instruction answers three questions: what to compute (an alu operation, denoted comp) where to store the computed value (dest) what to do next (jump) in the binary version, the leftmost bit is the c-instructionâs op-code, which is \\(1\\). the next two bits are not used, and are set by convention to \\(1\\). computation specification (comp) the computed function is specified by the a-bit and the six c-bits comprising the instruction's comp field. this \\(7\\)-bit pattern can potentially code \\(128\\) different calculations, of which only the twenty-eight listed in figure 4.5. in the alu the first input feeds from the d register, while the second alu input feeds either from the a register (when the a-bit is \\(0\\)) or from m, the selected data memory register (when the a-bit is \\(1\\)). destination specification (dest) the alu output can be stored in zero, one, two, or three possible destinations, simultaneously. the first and second d-bits code whether to store the computed value in the a register and in the d register, respectively. the third d-bit codes whether to store the computed value in m, the currently selected memory register. jump directive (jump) the jump field of the c-instruction specifies what to do next. there are two possibilities: fetch and execute the next instruction in the program, the default. fetch and execute some other instruction. in the latter case, we assume that the a register was already set to the address of the target instruction. whether or not to jump is determined jointly by the three j-bits. this gives eight possible jump conditions, listed on figure 4.5. symbols assembly instructions can specify memory locations (addresses) using either constants or symbols. predefined symbols r0, r1, â¦, r15: bound to the values \\(0\\) to \\(15\\). sp, lcl, arg, this, that: bound to the values \\(0\\), \\(1\\), \\(2\\), \\(3\\), and \\(4\\), respectively screen, kbd: bound, respectively, to the values \\(16384\\) and \\(24576\\). which are the base addresses of the screen memory map and the keyboard memory map. layer symbols the syntax (xxx) binds the symbol xxx to the address of the next instruction in the program. variable symbols any symbol xxx appearing in a hack assembly program that is not predefined and is not declared elsewhere using (xxx) is treated as a variable and is bound to a unique running number starting at \\(16\\). input/output handling the hack hardware platform can be connected to two peripheral i/o devices: a screen and a keyboard. screen: the computer interacts with a black-and-white screen organized as \\(256\\) rows of \\(512\\) pixels per row. so it is associated to a memory map stored in an \\(8\\)k memory block of \\(16\\)-bit words, starting at ram address \\(16384\\). each row in the physical screen, starting at the screen's top-left corner, is represented in the ram by \\(32\\) consecutive \\(16\\)-bit words. note that we cannot access individual pixels/bits directly, we must fetch a complete \\(16\\)-bit word (\\(16\\) pixels). keyboard: the computer can interact with a standard physical keyboard via a single-word memory map located at ram address \\(24576\\). when a key is pressed on the physical keyboard, its \\(16\\)-bit character code appears at ram[kbd]. when no key is pressed, the code \\(0\\) appears. $(\"pre\").each(function (index, item) { $(item).html(\"<code>\" + $(item).html() + \"</code>\"); }); hljs.highlightall(); "

    "body": " index search search back boolean arithmetic general-purpose computer systems are required to perform at least the following arithmetic operations on signed integers: addition sign conversion subtraction comparison multiplication division inside computers, everything is represented using binary codes. word size is a hardware term used for specifying the number of bits that computers use for representing a basic chunk of information. the fixed word size implies that there is a limit on the number of values that these registers can represent. for example, suppose we use 8-bit registers for representing integers. this representation can code \\(2^8 = 256\\). to represent numbers greater than, or less than, the maximal and minimal values permitted by the fixed register size is typically implemented by lashing together as many \\(n\\)-bit registers as necessary. binary addition a pair of binary numbers can be added bitwise from right to left by adding the two rightmost bits (lest significant bits or lsb). next, we add the resulting carry bit to the sum of the next pair of bits. we continue until the two left most significan bits (msb) are added. if the most significant bitwise addition generates a carry of 1, we have what is known as overflow. signed binary numbers we use two's complement (also known as radix complement) for representing signed numbers in binary code. given a word size of \\(n\\) bits, the two's complement for negative \\(x\\) is given by the binary code of \\(2^n - x\\). the twoâs complement representation has the following attractive properties: the system codes signed numbers, ranging from \\(-(2^{n-1})\\) to \\(2^{n-1} - 1\\) the code of any nonnegative number begins with a \\(0\\). the code of any negative number begins with a \\(1\\). to obtain the binary code of \\(-x\\) flip all the bits of x and add 1 to the result. subtraction is handled as a special case of addition. adders half adders: adds two bits, outputs two bits. full adder: adds three bits, outputs two bits. adder: adds two \\(n\\)-bit numbers. incrementer: adds \\(1\\) to a given number (spoiler: this will enable fetching the next instruction from memory, after executing the current one). the arithmetic logic unit an arithmetic logic unit is a chip designed to compute a set of arithmetic and logic operations. exactly which operations an alu should feature is a design decision. this alu design is unique to the computer built in nand to tetris, named hack. as seen in figure 2.5a, the hack alu operates on two \\(16\\)-bit two's complement integers, denoted \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), and on six \\(1\\)-bit inputs, called control bits. these control bits tell the alu which function to compute. the exact specification is given in figure 2.5b. note that each one of the six control bits is associated with a standalone, conditional micro-action. the six directives are to be performed in order: we either set the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) inputs to \\(0\\), or not we either negate the resulting values, or not we compute either \\(+\\) or \\(\\&\\) on the preprocessed values we either negate the resulting value, or not. all these settings, negations, additions, and conjunctions are \\(16\\)-bit operations. note that the alu actually computes a total of sixty-four functions, since six control bits code that many possibilities. weâve decided to focus on, and document, only eighteen of these possibilities, since these will suffice for supporting the instruction set of our target computer system $(\"pre\").each(function (index, item) { $(item).html(\"<code>\" + $(item).html() + \"</code>\"); }); hljs.highlightall(); "

    "body": " index search search back boolean logic boolean algebra boolean algebra manipulates two-state binary values. on figure 1.1 we present three commonly used boolean functions, also known as boolean operators. these functions are named and, or, and not. figure 1.2 begs the question: what makes and, or, and not more interesting? a deeper answer is that various subsets of logical operators can be used for expressing any boolean function, and {and, or, not} is one such subset. also, any one of these three basic operators can be expressed using nand gates only. every boolean function can be defined using two alternative representations: truth tables or boolean expressions. given a boolean function of n variables represented by a boolean expression, we can always construct from it the functionâs truth table and vice-versa. note that every boolean function can be represented by many different yet equivalent boolean expressions. so the ability to simplify a boolean expression is the first step toward hardware optimization. logic gates a gate is a physical device that implements a simple boolean function. gates can be realized with any alternative technology permitting switching and conducting capabilities. many hardware implementations of boolean functions were created, including magnetic, optical, biological, hydraulic, pneumatic, quantum-based, and even domino-based mechanisms. today, gates are typically implemented as transistors etched in silicon, packaged as chips. this means computer scientists don't have to worry about physical artifacts and can be content with the abstract notions of boolean algebra and gate logic, trusting blissfully that someone else will realize them in hardware. primitive and composite gates since all logic gates have the same input and output data types (0's and 1's), they can be combined, creating composite gates of arbitrary complexity. the right side of figure 1.5 gives the gate's internal architecture, or implementation, whereas the left side shows its interface. note that the interface of any given gate is unique, however it can be realized in many different ways. from an efficiency standpoint, the general rule is to try to use as few gates as possible. to sum up, the art of logic design can be described as follows: given a gate abstraction (also referred to as specification, or interface), find an efficient way to implement it using other gates that were already implemented. hardware construction today, hardware designers design the chip architecture using a formalism called hardware description language, or hdl by writing an hdl program. while the tests are carried out using computer simulation. the hardware designer will typically be interested in a variety of parameters such as speed of computation, energy consumption and the overall cost implied by the implementation. all these parameters can be simulated. after all tests and optimizations have been performed the final version of the hdl program can become the blueprint for the physical chip. figure 1.7, shows brief introduction to hdl, using an xor gate example. specification not: this gate outputs the opposite value of its input's value. and: returns 1 when both its inputs are 1, and 0 otherwise or: returns 1 when at least one of its inputs is 1, and 0 otherwise xor: also known as exclusive or, this gate returns 1 when exactly one of its inputs is 1, and 0 otherwise nand: realizes the following boolean function: multiplexer: a multiplexer is a three-input gate (see figure 1.9). the multiplexer uses sel to select and output the value of either \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). demultiplexer: takes a single input value and routes it to one of two possible outputs, according to a selector bit (see figure 1.10). multi-bit versions of basic gates computer hardware is often designed to process multi-bit valuesâfor example 16-bit inputs. multi-bit not: an n-bit not gate applies the boolean operation not to every one of the bits in its n-bit input. multi-bit and: an n-bit and gate applies the boolean operation and to every respective pair in its two n-bit inputs multi-bit or: an n-bit or gate applies the boolean operation or to every respective pair in its two n-bit inputs multi-bit multiplexer: an n-bit multiplexer operates exactly the same as a basic multiplexer, except that its inputs and output are n-bits wide multi-way versions of basic gates these are logic gates that can operate on more than two inputs, for example: multi-way or: an m-way or gate outputs 1 when at least one of its m input bits is 1, and 0 otherwise. multi-way/multi-bit multiplexer: an \\(m\\)-way \\(n\\)-bit multiplexer selects one of its \\(m\\) \\(n\\)-bit inputs, and outputs it to its \\(n\\)-bit output. the selection is specified by a set of \\(k\\) selection bits, where \\(k = \\log_2 m\\). for example, a \\(4\\)-way multiplexer is shown on the following image: $(\"pre\").each(function (index, item) { $(item).html(\"<code>\" + $(item).html() + \"</code>\"); }); hljs.highlightall(); "

    "body": " index search search back memory so far, all the chips were time independent, that is combinatorial. we introduce sequential chips, that depend not only on the inputs in the current time but also on inputs and outputs that have been processed previously. we model the progression of time using a clock that generates an ongoing train of binary signals that we call tick and tock. the time between the beginning of a tick and the end of the subsequent tock is called a cycle. memory devices a data flip flop (dff) is a time-dependent logic gate that can flip and flop between two stable states: representing \\(0\\) and \\(1\\). dffs are used as low-level chip-parts embedded deep within other memory devices (see figure 3.1.). dffs can be used to create \\(1\\)-bit registers and \\(n\\) such registers can be lashed together to create an \\(n\\)-bit register. next, a ram device is constructed using an arbitrary number of such registers. sequential logic on any operation outputs are always delayed, due to at least two reasons: the signal that represent the inputs travel from the outputs of other chips, which takes time. the computations that chips perform also take time. thus, time is an issue we must deal with. as seen at the top of figure 3.2, time is viewed as an arrow that progresses relentlessly forward. this progression is taken to be continuous: between every two time-points there is another time-point, and changes in the world can be infinitesimally small. instead of viewing time as a continuous progression, we break it into fixed-length intervals, cycles. where cycles are atomic and indivisible: changes in the world occur only during cycle transitions; within cycles, the world stands still. this discrete view of time serves two design objectives: it can be used for neutralizing the randomness associated with communications and computation time delays. second, it can be used for synchronizing the operations of different chips across the system. let's focus on the bottom part of figure 3.2, which tracks how a not gate (used as an example) responds to arbitrarily chosen inputs. when we feed the gate with \\(1\\), it takes a while before the gate's output stabilizes on \\(0\\). however, since the cycle duration isâby designâlonger than the time delay, when we reach the cycle's end, the gate output has already stabilized on \\(0\\). therefore the cycle's length must be longer than the maximal time delays that can occur in the system. in practice, we design our hardware such that the cycle is sufficiently long to contain any possible time delay taking into acount that, the shorter the cycle, the faster the computer. to sum up, the cycle length is chosen to be slightly longer than the maximal time delay in any chip in the system. typically, the cycles are realized by an oscillator that alternates continuously between two phases labeled \\(0\\)â\\(1\\), low-high, or ticktock. using the hardwareâs circuitry, the same master clock signal is simultaneously broadcast to every memory chip in the system. in every such chip, the clock input is funneled to the lower-level dff gates. flip-flops the low-level devices that facilitate the memory/storage abstraction are named flip-flop gates, in our case, data flip-flop or dff, whose interface includes a single-bit data input and a single-bit data output. in addition, the dff has a clock input that feeds from the master clockâs signal. taken together, the data input and the clock input enable the dff to implement the following behaviour \\(out(t) = in(t - 1)\\) combinational and sequential logic the most fundamental sequential gate is the dff, and any chip that includes it is also said to be sequential. as shown in figure 3.4, these sequential chips may also interact with combinational chips. in combinational chips, the introduction of feedback loops is problematic, because the output would depend on itself. however, if the feedback loop goes through a dff gate: the dff introduces an inherent time delay so that the output at time \\(t\\) does not depend on itself but rather on the output at time \\(t - 1\\). the time dependency of sequential chips has an important side effect that serves to synchronize the overall computer architecture. suppose we instruct the alu to compute \\(x + y\\), because of physical constraints the electric signals representing \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) will likely arrive at the alu at different times. it will take some time before the aluâs output stabilizes to the correct result. until then, the alu will generate garbage. random access memory a direct-access memory unit, also called random access memory, or ram, is an aggregate of \\(n\\) register chips (see figure 3.7). counter the counter is a chip that knows how to increment its value by 1 each time unit, aslo known as program counter or pc (see figure 3.8). $(\"pre\").each(function (index, item) { $(item).html(\"<code>\" + $(item).html() + \"</code>\"); }); hljs.highlightall(); "

the connect method is an asynchronous function, so it will execute a callback function when it finished connecting, or an error if the connection failed. in our case, we proceed to start our server when the database is ready. create models & schemas once we have successfully connected to our database, we will create our blog schema. for that, we first create a folder called models and inside it we create blog.js that will contain the following code: const mongoose = require('mongoose'); const schema = mongoose.schema; const blogschema = new schema({ title: { type: string, required: true, }, snippet: { type: string, required: true, }, body: { type: string, required: true }, }, { timestamps: true }); const blog = mongoose.model('blog', blogschema); module.exports = blog; as you can see, we first import mongoose and the schema object that we use to define the blog schema. in order to create a new blog schema we create a new schema object and we specify the different properties and restrictions. we also set and object of options, where we specify that we want mongodb to save the timestamps of updates, creations, etc. next we created a model that is based in the schema we just created with the function model and we pass it the model name (this name is then pluralized, as to then look up the collection that matches it) and the schema instance. getting/saving data in order to work we data, we must import the model we just created. const express = require('express'); const morgan = require('morgan'); const mongoose = require('mongoose'); const blog = require('./models/blog'); // express app const app = express(); // connect to mongodb & listen for requests const dburi = \"mongodb+srv://user:<password>@test.mongodb.net/<cluster_name> mongoose.connect(dburi, { usenewurlparser: true, useunifiedtopology: true }) .then(result => app.listen(3000)) .catch(err => console.log(err)); app.get('/blogs', (req, res) => { blog.find() .then(result => { res.send(result); }) .catch(err => { console.log(err); }); }); app.get('/blogs/:id', (req, res) => { const id = req.params.id; blog.findbyid(id) .then(result => { res.send(result); }) .catch(err => { console.log(err); }); }); here we use the find and findbyid methods to interact with our database. in order to create or delete new blogs: app.post('/blogs', (req, res) => { const blog = new blog(req.body); blog.save() .then(result => { res.redirect('/blogs'); }) .catch(err => { console.log(err); }); }); app.delete('/blogs/:id', (req, res) => { const id = req.params.id; blog.findbyidanddelete(id) .then(result => { res.json({ redirect: '/blogs' }); }) .catch(err => { console.log(err); }); }); in the post method we create a new blog object using the objects from the request body, and then we save it in our database. on the other hand, in order to delete a blog we pass the id as a parameter, we search for it on the database and we delete it. $(\"pre\").each(function (index, item) { $(item).html(\"<code>\" + $(item).html() + \"</code>\");

usememo note that this hook deals with values (which is the traditional functionality of the idea of memoizing), whilst react.memo look for changes in the props. in the next example we create a function that returns a value, and we memoize the function, so it only computes the value whenever the products change (the argument of the function), else it returns the value stored before: import react, { usestate, usecallback, usememo } from 'react' // custom hook import { usefetch } from 'usefetch' const url = 'https://course-api.com/javascript-store-products' // define the function we are going to memoize const calculatemostexpensive = (data) => { return ( data.reduce((total, item) => { const price = item.fields.price if (price >= total) { total = price } return total }, 0) / 100 ) } const index = () => { const { products } = usefetch(url);

    "body": " index search search back django notes in this section we lay out some concepts about the django framework. apps models the models can be thought of as objects, in the sense of oop, that have certain attributes. this objects are then mapped by django to the database of choice. to define new models, or modify existing model (e.g. the user model) you need to modify the models.py file in the root folder of every app that is created. alternatively, you can centralize all of your models on the core app. an example of a simple model is the following tag model: class tag(models.model): \"\"\"tag to be used for a book\"\"\" # define the attributes of the table name = models.charfield(max_length=255) # define the relation between the tag and the user user = models.foreignkey( settings.auth_user_model, on_delete=models.cascade, ) # define the string representation of the tag def __str__(self): return self.name once the model is define, it needs to be registered on the admin.py file: admin.site.register(models.tag) specifically when modifying existing models, you will need to extend the classes defined by django (e.g. abstractbaseuser, useradmin). for example: class user(abstractbaseuser, permissionsmixin): \"\"\"custom user model that suppors using email instead of username\"\"\" email = models.emailfield(max_length=255, unique=true) name = models.charfield(max_length=255) is_active = models.booleanfield(default=true) is_staff = models.booleanfield(default=false) objects = usermanager() which has to be registered as follows: admin.site.register(models.user, useradmin) where useradmin is a class define in the admin.py file, that defines the custom user model: class useradmin(baseuseradmin): ordering = ['id'] list_display = ['email', 'name'] # user edit page fields fieldsets = ( (none, {'fields': ('email', 'password')}), (_('personal info'), {'fields': ('name',)}), ( _('permissions'), {'fields': ('is_active', 'is_staff', 'is_superuser')} ), (_('important dates'), {'fields': ('last_login',)}) ) # user create page fields add_fieldsets = ( (none, { 'classes': ('wide',), 'fields': ('email', 'password', 'password2') }), admin this is the feature that allows you to manage your models, let it be create them, modify them or delete them. the functionality of the admin model is defined within the admin.py file on the root folder of every app that is created. in order to create a superuser execute the following command: $ python manage.py createsuperuser on docker: $ docker-compose run app sh -c \"python manage.py createsuperuser\" then, you will be prompted to enter an email and a password. once you have filled said fields, you can start the server with $ docker-compose up and enter to the admin page located on 127.0.0.1:8000/admin, where you can log in with your credentials. urls django allows us to define relative urls on a very modular way. first off, we have the core file when it comes to url definition: app/app/urls.py. here we may have something like this: from django.contrib import admin from django.urls import path, include urlpatterns = [ path('admin/', admin.site.urls), path('api/user/', include('user.urls')), ] this example shows that the urlpatterns variable is a list that holds all of the urls defined in our project. the modularization comes from the way the urls defined on the userâs app are specified. first we specify the endpoint for these urls (namely api/user/), and then we pull all the relative urls from the userâs app, defined on the file app/user/urls.py. which are then concatenated with api/user/. the urls defined on the user app are as follows: app_name = 'user' urlpatterns = [ path('create/', views.createuserview.as_view(), name='create'), ] this the can be used like this: # create user api endpoint dinamically create_user_url = reverse('user:create') serializers this files are defined to specify how to serialize (map to the database) the json objects received, in our case, from http requests. for that we create, for each model, a class that extends serializers.modelserializer. in this class we define an inner class called meta that tells the framework which fields does the object have and so allows the mapping to take place. you can also add extra arguments to this inner class, for example to restrict or exercise a stronger control on the fields. next on, we have a simple example of our user model serializer: from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model from rest_framework import serializers class userserializer(serializers.modelserializer): \"\"\"serializer for the users object\"\"\" class meta: \"\"\"info about how to serialize the user model\"\"\" model = get_user_model() fields = ('email', 'password', 'name') # extra requirements for the user model extra_kwargs = {'password': {'write_only': true, 'min_length': 5}} def create(self, validated_data): \"\"\"create a new user with encrypted password and return it\"\"\" # validation_data: json data passed in the http post return get_user_model().objects.create_user(**validated_data) we can also serialize an object that is not related to a model per se, for example: class authtokenserializer(serializers.serializer): \"\"\"serializer for the user authentication object\"\"\" email = serializers.charfield() password = serializers.charfield( style={'input_type': 'password'}, trim_whitespace=false ) views this is, on simple terms, a python function that takes a web request and returns a web response. in our case, we will mostly use views for our api, so we use pre-make view that allows us to easily make an api that creates, updates, etc an object on the database using the serializer that we specify, for example, the api for creating a user is as follows: class createuserview(generics.createapiview): \"\"\"create a new user in the system\"\"\" serializer_class = userserializer in case of wanting to update an object we extend generics.retrieveupdateapiview instead of generics.createapiview. because this view is private, we need to indicate an authentication mechanism and the level of permissions the user has, in our case the authentication is made via token and the permissions are that the user needs to be logged in. class manageuserview(generics.retrieveupdateapiview): \"\"\"manage the authenticated user\"\"\" serializer_class = userserializer # authentication mechanism by which the authentication happens authentication_classes = (authentication.tokenauthentication,) permission_classes = (permissions.isauthenticated,) def get_object(self): \"\"\"retrieve and return authentication user\"\"\" return self.request.user actions start the server observe that this is executed on the docker-compose configuration file $ python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000 sync django settings (app/app/settings.py) $ python manage.py migrate on docker: $ docker-compose run app sh -c \"python manage.py migrate\" sync changes made on models $ docker-compose run app sh -c \"python manage.py migrate\" on docker: $ docker-compose run app sh -c \"python manage.py makemigrations\" you can also specify the name off the app that contains the model $ python manage.py makemigrations app_name $(\"pre\").each(function (index, item) { $(item).html(\"<code>\" + $(item).html() + \"</code>\"); }); hljs.highlightall(); "

in general, it is true that \\(m = \\tan \\theta\\). function values of quadrantal angles conditions for undefined function values if the terminal side of the quadrantal angle lies along the y-axis (\\(x\\) equals zero), then the tangent and secant functions are undefined. if the terminal side of the quadrantal angle lies along the x-axis (\\(y\\) equals zero), then the cotangent and cosecant functions are undefined. reciprocal identities the definitions of the trigonometric functions were written to illustrate that certain function pairs are reciprocals of each other. since: \\begin{align} \\sin \\theta = \\frac{y}{r} \\end{align} and \\begin{align} \\csc \\theta = \\frac{r}{y} \\end{align} then: \\begin{align} \\sin \\theta = \\frac{1}{\\csc \\theta} \\end{align} therefore, the reciprocal identities are listed below: \\begin{align} \\sin \\theta = \\frac{1}{\\csc \\theta} \\end{align} \\begin{align} \\cos \\theta = \\frac{1}{\\sec \\theta} \\end{align} \\begin{align} \\tan \\theta = \\frac{1}{\\cot \\theta} \\end{align} \\begin{align} \\csc \\theta = \\frac{1}{\\sin \\theta} \\end{align} \\begin{align} \\sec \\theta = \\frac{1}{\\cos \\theta} \\end{align} \\begin{align} \\cot \\theta = \\frac{1}{\\tan \\theta} \\end{align} signs and ranges of function values a point \\((x, y)\\) in quadrant ii has \\(x < 0\\) and \\(y > 0\\). this makes the values of sine and cosecant positive for quadrant ii angles, while the other four functions take on negative values. similar results can be obtained for the other quadrants, as summarized here. in figure 37 we can see that as the measure of the angle increases, \\(y\\) increases, but never exceeds \\(r\\), so \\(y \\leq r\\). in a similar way, angles in quadrant iv suggest that \\(-r \\leq y\\). therefore: \\begin{align} -r \\leq y \\leq r \\end{align} \\begin{align} -1 \\leq \\frac{y}{r} \\leq 1 \\end{align} \\begin{align} -1 \\leq \\sin \\theta \\leq 1 \\end{align} similar reasoning leads to the following: \\begin{align} -1 \\leq \\cos \\theta \\leq 1 \\end{align} the tangent of an angle is defined as \\(\\frac{y}{x}\\). it is possible that \\(x < y\\), \\(x = y\\), or \\(x > y\\). for this reason, \\(\\frac{y}{x}\\) can take any value, so \\(\\tan \\theta\\) can be any real number, as can \\(\\cot \\theta\\). the functions \\(\\sec \\theta\\) and \\(\\csc \\theta\\) are reciprocals of the functions \\(\\cos \\theta\\) and \\(\\sin \\theta\\), respectively, making the following true: \\begin{align} \\sec \\theta \\leq -1 \\text{ or } \\sec \\theta \\geq 1 \\end{align}

    "title": "Angles and Their Measures",
    "body": " index search search back angles and their measures basic terminology two distinct points \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) determine a line called line \\(ab\\). the portion of the line between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), including points \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), is segment \\(ab\\). the portion of line \\(ab\\) that starts at \\(a\\) and continues through \\(b\\) and on past \\(b\\) is called ray \\(ab\\). point \\(a\\) is the endpoint of the ray. in trigonometry, an angle consists of two rays in a plane with a common endpoint, or two line segments with a common endpoint. these two rays (or segments) are called the sides of the angle and the common endpoint is called the vertex of the angle. associated with an angle is its measure, generated by a rotation about the vertex. this measure is determined by rotating a ray starting at one side of the angle, called the initial side, to the position of the other side, called the terminal side. a counterclockwise rotation generates an angle with positive measure, while a clockwise rotation generates an angle with negative measure. degree measure the most common unit used to measure the size of angles is the degree. we assign \\(360\\) degrees to a complete rotation of a ray. an angle measuring between \\(0\\)Â° and \\(90\\)Â° is an acute angle. an angle measuring exactly \\(90\\)Â° is a right angle. an angle measuring more than \\(90\\)Â° but less than \\(180\\)Â° is an obtuse angle, and an angle of exactly \\(180\\)Â° is a straight angle. if the sum of the measures of two positive angles is \\(90Â°\\), the angles are called complementary and the angles are complements. two positive angles with measures whose sum is \\(180Â°\\) are supplementary and the angles are supplements. one minute, written \\(1'\\), is \\(\\frac{1}{60}\\) of a degree and one second, \\(1''\\), is \\(\\frac{1}{60}\\) of a minute.however angles are commonly measured in decimal degrees. standard position and coterminal angles an angle is in standard position if its vertex is at the origin and its initial side is along the positive x-axis. the angles in (a) and (b) are in standard position. an angle in standard position is said to lie in the quadrant in which its terminal side lies, such as angles with measures \\(90Â°\\), \\(180Â°\\), \\(270Â°\\), and so on, are called quadrantal angles. if the terminal side lies along an axis, then the angle does not lie in any quadrant. for example, an acute angle is in quadrant i (a) and an obtuse angle is in quadrant ii (b). the angles whose measures differ by a multiple of \\(360Âº\\) are called coterminal angles. radian measure an angle with vertex at the center of a circle that intercepts an arc on the circle equal in length to the radius of the circle has measure \\(1\\) radian. an angle \\(\\theta\\) whose vertex is at the center of a circle is called central angle. in general, if \\(\\theta\\) is a central angle in a circle of radius \\(r\\), and \\(\\theta\\) intercepts an arc of lengt \\(s\\), the radian measure of \\(\\theta\\) is \\(\\frac{s}{r}\\). degree to radian conversion we know that the circumference of a circle is given by \\(c = 2\\pi r\\), where \\(r\\) is the radius. this shows that the radius can be laid \\(2\\pi\\) times around the circle. therefore, an angle of \\(360Â°\\), which corresponds to a complete circle, intercepts an arc equal in length to \\(2\\pi\\) times the radius of the circle. thus, an angle of \\(360Âº\\) has measure \\(2\\pi\\). \\begin{align} 360Âº = 2\\pi \\text{ radians} \\end{align} to convert a degree measure to radians multiply the degree measure by \\(\\frac{2\\pi}{360} = \\frac{\\pi}{180}\\) to convert a radian measure to degrees multiply the radian measure by \\(\\frac{360}{2\\pi} = \\frac{180}{\\pi}\\) arc lengths and areas of sectors in the following figure angle \\(qop\\) has measure \\(1\\) radian and intercepts an arc of length \\(r\\). while angle \\(rot\\) has measure \\(\\theta\\) radians and intercepts an arc of length \\(s\\). since the lengths of the arcs are proportional to the measures of their central angles: \\begin{align} \\frac{s}{r} = \\frac{\\theta}{1} \\end{align} \\begin{align} s = r\\theta \\end{align} a sector of a circle is the portion of the interior of a circle intercepted by a central angle. the interior of a circle can be thought of as a sector intercepted by a central angle of measure \\(2\\pi\\) radians. if a central angle for a sector has measure \\(\\theta\\) radians, then the sector makes up the fraction \\(\\frac{\\theta}{2\\pi}\\) of a complete circle. the area inside a circle with radius \\(r\\) is \\(\\mathcal{a} = \\pi r^2\\), therefore, the area of the sector is given by the product of the fraction \\(\\frac{\\theta}{2\\pi}\\) and the total area: \\[ \\mathcal{a} = \\frac{\\theta}{2\\pi}(\\pi r^2) = \\frac{1}{1}r^2 \\theta, \\theta \\text{ in radians} \\] linear and angular speed suppose that point \\(p\\) moves at a constant speed along a circle of radius \\(r\\) and center \\(o\\). the measure of how fast the position of \\(p\\) is changing is called linear speed. if \\(v\\) represents linear speed, then: \\begin{align} v = \\frac{s}{t} \\end{align} where \\(s\\) is the length of the arc traced by point \\(p\\) in time \\(t\\). (this formula is just a restatement of \\(d = rt\\) with \\(s\\) as distance, \\(v\\) as rate (speed), and \\(t\\) as time.) as point \\(p\\) moves along the circle, ray \\(op\\) rotates around the origin, so the speed at which the measure ofthe angle changes is called angular speed, \\(\\omega\\) and is given by: \\begin{align} \\omega = \\frac{\\theta}{t}, \\theta \\text{ in radians} \\end{align} where \\(\\theta\\) is the measure of angle \\(pob\\). to relate linear and angular speeds we use the result \\(s = r\\theta\\), therefor: \\begin{align} v = \\frac{s}{t} = \\frac{r\\theta}{t} = r \\frac{\\theta}{t} = r \\omega \\end{align} appendix latitude gives the measure of a central angle with vertex at earth's center whose initial side goes through the equator and whose terminal side goes through the given location (basically like north-south orientation). $(\"pre\").each(function (index, item) { $(item).html(\"<code>\" + $(item).html() + \"</code>\"); }); hljs.highlightall(); "

    "body": " index search search back circles and parabolas conic sections parabolas, circles, ellipses, and hyperbolas form a group of curves known as the conic sections, because they are the result of intersecting a cone with a plane. circle a circle is a set of points in a plane that are equidistant from a fixed point. the distance is called the radius of the circle, and the fixed point is called the center. suppose a circle has center \\((h, k)\\) and radius \\(r > 0\\). then the distance between the center \\((h, k)\\) and any point \\((x, y)\\) on the circle must equal \\(r\\). thus, an equation of the circle is as follows: \\begin{align} \\sqrt{(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2} = r \\end{align} \\begin{align} (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 \\end{align} therefore the centerâradius form of the equation of a circle with center \\((h, k)\\) and radius \\(r\\) is: \\begin{align} (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 \\end{align} notice that a circle is the graph of a relation that is not a function. a circle with center \\((0, 0)\\) and radius \\(r\\) has equation: \\begin{align} x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \\end{align} general form of the equation of a circle for real numbers \\(c\\), \\(d\\), and \\(e\\), the equation: \\begin{align} x^2 + y^2 + cx + dy + e = 0 \\end{align} can have a graph that is a circle, that is a point, or that is empty (contains no points.) starting with an equation in this general form, we can work in reverse by completing the square to get an equation of the form: \\begin{align} (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = m \\text{ for some } m \\end{align} there are three possibilities for the graph, based on the value of \\(m\\): if \\(m > 0\\), then \\(r^2 = m\\), and the equation represents a circle with radius \\(\\sqrt{m}\\). if \\(m = 0\\), the equation represents the single point \\((h, k)\\). if \\(m < 0\\), no points satisfy the equation and the graph is empty. parabola a parabola is a set of points in a plane equidistant from a fixed point and a fixed line. the fixed point is called the focus, and the fixed line the directrix, of the parabola. we can find an equation of a parabola from the preceding definition. let the directrix be the line \\(y = -c\\) and the focus be the point \\(f\\) with coordinates \\((0, c)\\). given a point \\(p\\) on the parabola, with coordinates \\((x, y)\\), using the distance formula gives the following result: \\begin{align} d(p, f) = d(p, d) \\end{align} \\begin{align} \\sqrt{(x - 0)^2 + (y - c)^2} = \\sqrt{(x - x)^2 + [y - (-c)]^2} \\end{align} \\begin{align} x^2 + (y - c)^2 = [y +c]^2 \\end{align} \\begin{align} x^2 + (y - c)^2 = (y + c)^2 \\end{align} \\begin{align} x^2 + y^2 + c^2 - 2cy = y^2 + c^2 + 2cy \\end{align} \\begin{align} x^2 = 4cy \\end{align} the focal chord through the focus and perpendicular to the axis of symmetry of a parabola is called the latus rectum, and has length \\(|4c|\\). to see this, note in the previous image that the endpoints of the chord are \\((-x, c)\\) and \\((x, c)\\). let \\(y = c\\) in the equation of the parabola and solve for \\(x\\). \\begin{align} x^2 = 4cy \\end{align} \\begin{align} x^2 = 4c^2 \\end{align} \\begin{align} x = |2c| \\end{align} the length of half the focal chord is |2c| (from x = 0 to x = 2c or x = -2c) , so its full length is |4c|. parabola with a horizontal axis and vertex \\((0, 0)\\) the parabola with focus \\((c, 0)\\) and directrix \\(x = -c\\) has equation: \\begin{align} y^2 = 4cx \\end{align} the parabola has vertex \\((0, 0)\\), horizontal axis \\(y = 0\\), and opens to the right if \\(c > 0\\) or to the left if \\(c < 0\\). notice that the graph of a parabola with a horizontal axis is not a function. equation forms for translated parabolas a parabola with vertex \\((h, k)\\) has an equation of the form: vertical axis: \\begin{align} (x - h)^2 = 4c(y - k) \\end{align} horizontal axis: \\begin{align} (y - k)^2 = 4c(x - h) \\end{align} where the focus is a distance \\(|c|\\) from the vertex: $(\"pre\").each(function (index, item) { $(item).html(\"<code>\" + $(item).html() + \"</code>\"); }); hljs.highlightall(); "
