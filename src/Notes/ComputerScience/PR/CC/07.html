We seldom control all the software in our systems. Sometimes we buy third-party packages or use open source. Other times we depend on teams in our own company to produce components or subsystems for us.  In this chapter we look at practices and techniques to keep the boundaries of our software clean.
</p>

<div id="Boundaries-Using Third-Party Code"><h2 id="Using Third-Party Code" class="header"><a href="#Boundaries-Using Third-Party Code">Using Third-Party Code</a></h2></div>

<p>
There is a natural tension between the provider of an interface and the user of an interface. Providers: which strive for broad applicability and users: which are want an interface focused on their particular needs. 
</p>

<p>
Let’s look at <code>java.util.Map</code> as an example. If our application needs a Map of Sensors, you might find the sensors set up like this:
</p>

<pre java="">Map sensors = new HashMap();
</pre>

<p>
Then, when some other part of the code needs to access the sensor, you see this code:
</p>

<pre java="">Sensor s = (Sensor)sensors.get(sensorId);
</pre>

<p>
The readability of this code can be greatly improved by using generics, as shown below:
</p>

<pre java="">Map&lt;Sensor&gt; sensors = new HashMap&lt;Sensor&gt;();
...
Sensor s = sensors.get(sensorId );
</pre>

<p>
However, this doesn’t solve the problem that <code>Map&lt;Sensor&gt;</code> provides more capability than we need. Also there will be a lot of places to fix if the interface to <code>Map</code> ever changes. A cleaner way to use Map might look like the following. 
</p>

<pre java="">public class Sensors {
  private Map sensors = new HashMap();
  
  public Sensor getById(String id) {
    return (Sensor) sensors.get(id);
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
So the interface at the boundary (<code>Map</code>) is hidden. This interface is also tailored and constrained to meet the needs of the application. It results in code that is easier to understand and harder to misuse.
</p>

<p>
We could write some tests to explore our understanding of the third-party code (learning tests).  We call the third-party API, as we expect to use it in our application. Not only are learning tests free, they have a positive return on investment. When there are new releases of the third-party package, we run the learning tests to see whether there are behavioral differences.
</p>

<div id="Boundaries-Using Code That Does Not Yet Exist"><h2 id="Using Code That Does Not Yet Exist" class="header"><a href="#Boundaries-Using Code That Does Not Yet Exist">Using Code That Does Not Yet Exist</a></h2></div>

<p>
There is another kind of boundary, one that separates the known from the unknown. There are often places in the code where our knowledge seems to drop off the edge.
</p>

<p>
For example, there was a subsystem, the “Transmitter,” that we knew little about, and the people responsible for the subsystem had not gotten to the point of defining their interface. So we defined our own interface, this was the interface we wished we had.
</p>

<p>
This design also gives us a very convenient seam3 in the code for testing.
</p>

<div id="Boundaries-Clean Boundaries"><h2 id="Clean Boundaries" class="header"><a href="#Boundaries-Clean Boundaries">Clean Boundaries</a></h2></div>

<p>
Good software designs accommodate change without huge investments and rework. We manage third-party boundaries by having very few places in the code that refer to them. We may wrap them as we did with <code>Map</code>, or we may use an <span id="Boundaries-Clean Boundaries-ADAPTER"></span><strong id="ADAPTER">ADAPTER</strong> to convert from our perfect interface to the provided interface.
