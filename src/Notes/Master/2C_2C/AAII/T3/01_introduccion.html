While the idea of combining classifiers is not new, there is still a lot of scope for developing new combination approaches, types of features and classifiers used, and novel applications.
</p>

<p>
Fumera et al. presented a theoretical and experimental analysis of multiple classifiers with a focus on linear combiners. The authors particularly focused on simple and weighted averaging. Their analysis showed that the performance of linear combiners depends on the accuracy of the individual classifiers and the correlation between their outputs. They also showed that the weighted averaging rule outperforms simple averaging. In weighted averaging, finding the optimal weights for each classifier is still an open problem. Further research areas can involve the use of meta-heuristic optimization approaches such as the Bat algorithm and other related techniques.
</p>

<p>
In [8], Polikar discussed the idea of combining classifiers' output labels in comparison with combination using classifiers' continuous outputs as well as their application to ensemble based systems. 
</p>

<p>
In combining continuous outputs, the degrees of support given to each class, by the different classifiers, are used by the combination technique. This support is referred to as score in some literatures. The classifiers output labels are mainly combined using majority voting or its variants. The author primarily reviewed conditions for which ensemble based systems outperform individual classifiers. Different combination techniques were analyzed in details. In conclusion, the author stated that no single ensemble generation algorithm or combination rule is universally better than others. 
</p>

<p>
While there are several review papers in the literature, this paper presents a more updated survey including more recent approaches introduced during the past few years. Since the last major review paper [10], several novel techniques have been introduced. These include a signal strength based combining approach [11], a novel Bayes voting strategy [12], a modified weighted averaging technique using graph-theoretical clustering [13], a neural network based approach for training the combination rules [14], weighted features combination [15], and hierarchical fuzzy stack generalization [16], among others.
