<p>
Suppose every place in the world is modeled after an uniform probability distribution, then every cell the robot has the same probability.
</p>

<div id="Histogram Localization-Probability after Sense"><h2 id="Probability after Sense" class="header"><a href="#Histogram Localization-Probability after Sense">Probability after Sense</a></h2></div>

<p>
Now suppose the robot is able to sense a color, and each cell has a different color assigned.
</p>

<p>
Let's assume the robot senses the color red, then the cells with this color assigned should have a higher probability. Therefore we define two values, a hit value and a miss value. 
</p>

<p>
If the cell is red, then we multiply its probability by the hit value.
If the cell is not red, then we multiply its probability by the miss value.
</p>

<p>
Note that the hit value is a big value, and the miss value is lower. Thus the probability for miss cells is lower than the probability for hit cells.
Also, observe that a measurement refers to what the robot senses, that is, a green cell or a red cell.
</p>

<div id="Histogram Localization-Probability after Sense-Normalize the distribution"><h3 id="Normalize the distribution" class="header"><a href="#Histogram Localization-Probability after Sense-Normalize the distribution">Normalize the distribution</a></h3></div>

<p>
Now that we have altered the values of the probability distribution, it is likely that they do not sum up to one, which is a requirement to every probability function. Therefore we need to normalize it.
</p>

<p>
So what we would do is:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Compute the probabilities after the robot "senses" a measurement

</li><li>
Normalize these probabilities by dividing each probability by the total sum of all probabilities

</li></ol>
<hr>

<div id="Histogram Localization-Exact Motion"><h2 id="Exact Motion" class="header"><a href="#Histogram Localization-Exact Motion">Exact Motion</a></h2></div>

<p>
Suppose we have a world made up of a grid with 5 cells with the following probabilities:
</p>

<p>
[\(\frac{1}{3}\)][\(\frac{1}{3}\)][\(\frac{1}{9}\)][\(\frac{1}{9}\)][\(\frac{1}{3}\)]
</p>

<p>
We also know that with 100% probability the world moves to the right. 
</p>

<div id="Histogram Localization-Exact Motion-Theorem of Total Probability"><h3 id="Theorem of Total Probability" class="header"><a href="#Histogram Localization-Exact Motion-Theorem of Total Probability">Theorem of Total Probability</a></h3></div>

<p>
To compute the probability of each cell after the movement, we use the law of total probability that states:
</p>

<p>
Given events A and \(B = \{B_1, \cdots, B_n\}\) events in a sample space where \(B\) is pairwise disjoint, then:
</p>

\begin{align}
P(A) = \sum_n P(A \cap B_n)
\end{align}

<p>
Then, by the conditional probability formula:
</p>

\begin{align}
P(A) = \sum_n P(A|B_n)P(B_n)
\end{align}

<hr>

<p>
So to apply this theorem what we do is sum the probabilities of ending up in cell \(j\) when we come from cell \(i\), which is expressed symbolically:
</p>

\begin{align}
P(X_{j}) = \sum_{i=1}^5 P(X_{j}|X_{i}) \cdot P(X_{i}) = 1 \cdot P({X_j}_{\{j=(i+1)\}})
\end{align}

<p>
Because we know:
</p>

\begin{align}
P(X_j|X_i) = 
\begin{cases} 
1, &amp; j = i + 1 \\
0, &amp; \text{ in any other case}
\end{cases}
\end{align}

<div id="Histogram Localization-Inexact Motion"><h2 id="Inexact Motion" class="header"><a href="#Histogram Localization-Inexact Motion">Inexact Motion</a></h2></div>

<p>
However what if \(P(X_j|X_i) &lt; 1\)? Suppose:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
\(P(X_{i+2}|X_i) = 0.8\): the robot moved 2 positions/units with \(0.8\) probability

</li><li>
\(P(X_{i+1}|X_i) = 0.1\): the robot moved 1 positions/units with \(0.1\) probability

</li><li>
\(P(X_{i+3}|X_i) = 0.1\): the robot moved 3 positions/units with \(0.1\) probability

</li></ul>
<p>
Then for each \(i\):
</p>

\begin{align}
P(X_{j}) = \sum_{i=1}^5 P(X_{j}|X_{i}) \cdot P(X_{i})
\end{align}

<p>
Where:
</p>

\begin{align}
P(X_{j}|X_{i}) = 
\begin{cases}
0.8, &amp; j = i + 2 \\
0.1, &amp; j = i + 1 \\
0.1, &amp; j = i + 3 \\
0, &amp; \text{ otherwhise }
\end{cases}
\end{align}

<div id="Histogram Localization-Inexact Motion-Entropy"><h3 id="Entropy" class="header"><a href="#Histogram Localization-Inexact Motion-Entropy">Entropy</a></h3></div>

<p>
The entropy will decrease after the measurement update (sense) step, and the entropy will increase after the movement step (move).
</p>

<p>
In general, entropy represents the amount of uncertainty in a system. Since the measurement update step decreases uncertainty, entropy will decrease. The movement step increases uncertainty, so entropy will increase after this step.
</p>

<p>
The entropy formula for our case is the following:
</p>

\begin{align}
Entropy = \sum_{i=1}^5(-p(x_i) \cdot \log(p(x_i)))
\end{align}

<hr>

<div id="Histogram Localization-Bayes Rule"><h2 id="Bayes Rule" class="header"><a href="#Histogram Localization-Bayes Rule">Bayes Rule</a></h2></div>

<p>
Suppose:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
\(X\) represents the grid cell

</li><li>
\(Z\) represents the measurements

</li></ol>
<p>
Then the Bayes rule states:
</p>

\begin{align}
P(X_i|Z) = \frac{P(Z|X_i)P(X_i)}{P(Z)}
\end{align}

<p>
Where:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
\(P(X_i|Z)\) is called the posterior

</li><li>
\(P(Z|X_i)\) is called the likelihood

</li><li>
\(P(Z)\) is known as the evidence or marginal likelihood (that is, it marginalizes \(Z\)). To compute \(P(Z)\) we use the theorem of total probability:
\begin{align}
P(Z) = \sum_{i=1}^n P(Z|X_i)P(X_i)  
\end{align}

</li></ul>
<p>
So, to compute \(P(X_i|Z)\) we follow the steps:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
For each \(X_i\) compute the non-normalized posterior: \(\hat{P}(X_i|Z) = P(Z|X_i)P(X_i)\)

</li><li>
Sum all non-normalized posteriors to obtain the evidence: \(P(Z) = \sum_{i=1}^n \hat{P}(X_i|Z)\)

</li><li>
For each \(X_i\) normalize the posterior with the evidence: \(P(X_i|Z) = \frac{\hat{P}(X_i|Z)}{P(Z)}\)

</li></ol>
<div id="Histogram Localization-Motion using Total Probability"><h2 id="Motion using Total Probability" class="header"><a href="#Histogram Localization-Motion using Total Probability">Motion using Total Probability</a></h2></div>

<p>
Let's say we are at time \(t\), and \(i\) determines the cell, then the motion is expressed probabilistically as follows:
</p>

\begin{align}
P(X_i^t) = \sum_{j} P(X_i|X_j)P(X_j^{t-1})
\end{align}

<p>
If we break down this formula:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
\(P(X_i|X_j)\) is the probability that we end up in the cell \(X_i\) given we come from the cell \(X_j\)

</li><li>
\(P(X_j^{t-1})\) is the probability of being in cell \(X_j\) at the previous time

</li><li>
\(P(X_i^t)\) is the probability of being in cell \(X_i\) at time \(t\)

</li></ul>
<hr>

<div id="Histogram Localization-Summary"><h2 id="Summary" class="header"><a href="#Histogram Localization-Summary">Summary</a></h2></div>

<div id="Histogram Localization-Summary-Belief"><h3 id="Belief" class="header"><a href="#Histogram Localization-Summary-Belief">Belief</a></h3></div>

<p>
Represents where are possible places the robot might be, that is each cell has an associated probability value
</p>

<div id="Histogram Localization-Summary-Sense"><h3 id="Sense" class="header"><a href="#Histogram Localization-Summary-Sense">Sense</a></h3></div>

<p>
Also known as the measurement update function. 
</p>

<p>
For each cell we compute the probability that the robot is in that cell, given a measurement sensed by the robot in the moment \(t\) (\(P(X_k|Z)\), where \(X_k\) is the cell and \(Z\) is the measurement). 
</p>

<p>
Therefore, for each cell in the world we multiply the previous probability value (given by belief) and the probability that the robot moved to the given cell. For example, 
To satisfy the probability function properties, we need to normalize it, so it sums up to one.
</p>

<div id="Histogram Localization-Summary-Move"><h3 id="Move" class="header"><a href="#Histogram Localization-Summary-Move">Move</a></h3></div>

<p>
It is a convolution, for each possible location, after the motion, we reverse engineered the situation and guessed where the world might have come from.
</p>

<p>
So what we do is we compute the probability of each cell using the Total Probability Theorem, so given a cell \(X_k\), we compute:
</p>

\begin{align}
P(X_k) = \sum_{l}P(X_k|X_l)P(X_l)
\end{align}

<p>
Where \(P(X_k|X_l)\) is the probabily that the robot moved to cell \(X_k\) from cell \(X_l\). 
</p>

<p>
Usually what we do is stablish a motion using a vector (i.e. \((0,1) \in \mathbb{R}^2\) to indicate the robot moved one unit up in the two dimensional vector space). 
</p>

<p>
For example, this probability may refer to how likely it is that the robot moved to the exact cell, how likely it is that the robot moved to a cell "beyond" the goal or how likely it is that the robot moved to a cell that lies "before" the goal.
</p>

<p>
So if we have these three probabilities, for each cell we sum the probabilities of the robot being in that cell taking into account the three scenarions:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
If the robot moved to cell \(X_k\) from cell \(X_l\), and that cell was the goal, then it moved to that cell with probability \(P_{exact}\)

</li><li>
And maybe the robot moved to cell \(X_k\) from cell \(X_i\), however the goal was \(X_{k+1}\), then it moved to that cell with probability probability \(P_{undershoot}\)

</li><li>
Maybe the robot moved to cell \(X_k\) from cell \(X_j\), however the goal was \(X_{k-1}\), then it moved to that cell with probability probability \(P_{overshoot}\)

</li></ul>
<p>
Suppose now that then only cells in the world are mentioned: \(X_k, X_l, X_i, X_j\). Then for \(X_k\) we update the belief as follows:
</p>

\begin{align}
P(X_k) = P(X_l) * P_{exact} + P(X_i) * P_{undershoot} + P(X_j) * P_{overshoot}
\end{align}

<p>
Next we lay out an example of the localization algorithm implemented in \(\mathbb{R}^2\):
</p>

<pre python=""># The function localize takes the following arguments:
#

#        2D list, each entry either 'R' (for red cell) or 'G' (for green cell)
#
# measurements:
#        list of measurements taken by the robot, each entry either 'R' or 'G'
#
# motions:
#        list of actions taken by the robot, each entry of the form [dy,dx],
#        where dx refers to the change in the x-direction (positive meaning
#        movement to the right) and dy refers to the change in the y-direction
#        (positive meaning movement downward)
#        NOTE: the *first* coordinate is change in y; the *second* coordinate is
#              change in x
#
# sensor_right:
#        float between 0 and 1, giving the probability that any given
#        measurement is correct; the probability that the measurement is
#        incorrect is 1-sensor_right
#
# p_move:
#        float between 0 and 1, giving the probability that any given movement
#        command takes place; the probability that the movement command fails

</pre>

<p>
So for example, for the following data:
</p>

<pre python="">colors = [['R','G','G','R','R'],
          ['R','R','G','R','R'],
          ['R','R','G','G','R'],
          ['R','R','R','R','R']]
measurements = ['G','G','G','G','G']
motions = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,0],[0,1]]
</pre>

<p>
Where:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
The robot does not move (\([0,0]\)) and senses a green cell <code>'G'</code>.

</li><li>
The robot moves down (\([0,1]\)) and senses a green cell <code>'G'</code>.

</li><li>
The robot moves right (\([1,0]\)) and senses a green cell <code>'G'</code>.

</li><li>
The robot moves right (\([1,0]\)) and senses a green cell <code>'G'</code>.

</li><li>
The robot moves down (\([0,1]\)) and senses a green cell <code>'G'</code>.

</li></ol>
<p>
And the <code>colors</code> is the representation of the world. Then, we apply the localization algorithm to obtain the probability distribution that the robot is in each cell:
</p>

<pre python="">p = localize(colors,measurements,motions,sensor_right = 0.7, p_move = 0.8)
show(p)
</pre>

<p>
Note that the probabily that the robot sensed the measurement correctly (\(P(Z|X_i)\)) is \(0.7\) and the probability that the robot moved to the cell given by the motion vector (\(P(X_i|X_j)\)) is \(0.8\). This outputs:
</p>

<pre>[[0.01106,0.02464,0.06800,0.04472,0.02465],
 [0.00715,0.01017,0.08697,0.07988,0.00935],

 [0.00911,0.00715,0.01435,0.04313,0.03643]]
</pre>

<p>
Where each element in the matrix is the probabily of a cell.
