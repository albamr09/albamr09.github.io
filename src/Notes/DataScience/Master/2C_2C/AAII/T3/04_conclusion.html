While a large number of combination techniques have been proposed, the literature still lacks a comprehensive performance analysis of such techniques for a given application. The review showed that while one strategy (e.g. fusion at decision level) may outperform others for a given application, the results from such a strategy may not be the best for another application. 
</p>

<p>
However overall, it was shown that classifiers combinations in general improve performance significantly over individual classifiers for most problems.
</p>

<p>
An important research direction relies on adding an enhancement stage (post processing) to the classifiers output before applying combination rules. This would improve the performance of individual classifiers before the combination stage. Many classifiers combination techniques have performed well under certain restrictions which include independence assumption, Gaussian distribution, linear process, limited class problem (mostly 2-class problem) and low dimensional feature space. Thus, future work can reconsider relaxing some of these constraints
</p>

<p>
Another issue that needs to be further investigated is to explore the advantages of using different strategies for the fusion including probabilistic, learning, decision based, or evidence based techniques.
</p>

<p>
The discussion on voting based approaches has shown that there is a scope for improving classification accuracy. This issue also offers numerous opportunities for developing optimization techniques to determine the weights. Some of the approaches including GA, PSO, and Ant optimization techniques, among others, can be investigated.
</p>

<p>
Neural networks as well as similar models such as fuzzy networks, deep neural networks; SVM, etc. also offer an excellent opportunity for developing adaptive techniques to combine individual classifiers outputs. For example, can individual classifiers be considered as layers of more general architectures.
</p>

<p>
Computational complexity is an important issue that needs further research especially when the different algorithms are deployed over mobile or low power platform
</p>

<p>
An important issue which is still open is that of finding the optimal number of classifiers to be combined for a given application. Additionally, for a given number of features, is there a way to distribute these among the different classifiers to be combined.
</p>

<p>
Finally, the use of hybrid approaches to integrate results from different combination techniques, offers further opportunities for solving more involved applications.
