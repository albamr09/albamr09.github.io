<p>
Two distinct points \(A\) and \(B\) determine a line called <span id="Angles and Their Measures-Basic Terminology-line"></span><strong id="line">line</strong> \(AB\). The portion of the line between \(A\) and \(B\), including points \(A\) and \(B\), is <span id="Angles and Their Measures-Basic Terminology-segment"></span><strong id="segment">segment</strong> \(AB\). The portion of line \(AB\) that starts at \(A\) and continues through \(B\) and on past \(B\) is called <span id="Angles and Their Measures-Basic Terminology-ray"></span><strong id="ray">ray</strong> \(AB\). Point \(A\) is the endpoint of the ray.

<p>
In trigonometry, an <span id="Angles and Their Measures-Basic Terminology-angle"></span><strong id="angle">angle</strong> consists of two rays in a plane with a common endpoint, or two line segments with a common endpoint. These two rays (or segments) are called the <span id="Angles and Their Measures-Basic Terminology-sides"></span><strong id="sides">sides</strong> of the angle and the common endpoint is called the <span id="Angles and Their Measures-Basic Terminology-vertex"></span><strong id="vertex">vertex</strong> of the angle.
</p>

<p>
Associated with an angle is its <span id="Angles and Their Measures-Basic Terminology-measure"></span><strong id="measure">measure</strong>, generated by a rotation about the vertex. This measure is determined by rotating a ray starting at one side of the angle, called the <span id="Angles and Their Measures-Basic Terminology-initial side"></span><strong id="initial side">initial side</strong>, to the position of the other side, called the <span id="Angles and Their Measures-Basic Terminology-terminal side"></span><strong id="terminal side">terminal side</strong>.

<div id="Angles and Their Measures-Degree Measure"><h2 id="Degree Measure" class="header"><a href="#Angles and Their Measures-Degree Measure">Degree Measure</a></h2></div>

<p>
The most common unit used to measure the size of angles is the <span id="Angles and Their Measures-Degree Measure-degree"></span><strong id="degree">degree</strong>. We assign \(360\) degrees to a complete rotation of a ray.
</p>

<p>
An angle measuring between \(0\)° and \(90\)° is an <span id="Angles and Their Measures-Degree Measure-acute angle"></span><strong id="acute angle">acute angle</strong>. An angle measuring exactly \(90\)° is a <span id="Angles and Their Measures-Degree Measure-right angle"></span><strong id="right angle">right angle</strong>. An angle measuring more than \(90\)° but less than \(180\)° is an <span id="Angles and Their Measures-Degree Measure-obtuse angle"></span><strong id="obtuse angle">obtuse angle</strong>, and an angle of exactly \(180\)° is a <span id="Angles and Their Measures-Degree Measure-straight angle"></span><strong id="straight angle">straight angle</strong>.

<p>
If the sum of the measures of two positive angles is \(90°\), the angles are called <span id="Angles and Their Measures-Degree Measure-complementary"></span><strong id="complementary">complementary</strong> and the angles are <span id="Angles and Their Measures-Degree Measure-complements"></span><strong id="complements">complements</strong>.

<p>
One minute, written \(1'\), is \(\frac{1}{60}\) of a degree and one second, \(1''\), is \(\frac{1}{60}\) of a minute.However angles are commonly measured in decimal degrees.

<div id="Angles and Their Measures-Standard Position and Coterminal Angles"><h2 id="Standard Position and Coterminal Angles" class="header"><a href="#Angles and Their Measures-Standard Position and Coterminal Angles">Standard Position and Coterminal Angles</a></h2></div>

<p>
An angle is in <span id="Angles and Their Measures-Standard Position and Coterminal Angles-standard position"></span><strong id="standard position">standard position</strong> if its vertex is at the origin and its initial side is along the positive x-axis. The angles in (a) and (b) are in standard position.
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://albamr09.github.io/public/assets/angle_standard_position.png" alt="Standard Position" style="width:600px;height:250px"> 
</p>

<p>
An angle in standard position is said to lie in the quadrant in which its terminal side lies, such as angles with measures \(90°\), \(180°\), \(270°\), and so on, are called <span id="Angles and Their Measures-Standard Position and Coterminal Angles-quadrantal angles"></span><strong id="quadrantal angles">quadrantal angles</strong>. If the terminal side lies along an axis, then the angle does not lie in any quadrant. For example, an acute angle is in quadrant I (a) and an obtuse angle is in quadrant II (b).
</p>

<p>
The angles whose measures differ by a multiple of \(360º\) are called <span id="Angles and Their Measures-Standard Position and Coterminal Angles-coterminal angles"></span><strong id="coterminal angles">coterminal angles</strong>.

<div id="Angles and Their Measures-Radian Measure"><h2 id="Radian Measure" class="header"><a href="#Angles and Their Measures-Radian Measure">Radian Measure</a></h2></div>

<p>
An angle with vertex at the center of a circle that intercepts an arc on the circle equal in length to the radius of the circle has measure *\(1\) radian*.
</p>

<p>
An angle \(\theta\) whose vertex is at the center of a circle is called <span id="Angles and Their Measures-Radian Measure-central angle"></span><strong id="central angle">central angle</strong>.
</p>

<p>
In general, if \(\theta\) is a central angle in a circle of radius \(r\), and \(\theta intercepts an arc of lengt \)s\(, the radian measure of \)\theta\( is \)\frac{s}{r}$.
</p>

<div id="Angles and Their Measures-Radian Measure-Degree to Radian Conversion"><h3 id="Degree to Radian Conversion" class="header"><a href="#Angles and Their Measures-Radian Measure-Degree to Radian Conversion">Degree to Radian Conversion</a></h3></div>

<p>
We know that the circumference of a circle is given by \(C = 2\pi r\), where \(r\) is the radius. This shows that the radius can be laid \(2\pi\) times around the circle.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, an angle of \(360°\), which corresponds to a complete circle, intercepts an arc equal in length to \(2\pi\) times the radius of the circle. Thus, an angle of \(360º\) has measure \(2\pi\).
</p>

\begin{align}
360º = 2\pi \text{ radians}
\end{align}

<ul>
<li>
To convert a degree measure to radians multiply the degree measure by \(\frac{2\pi}{360} = \frac{\pi}{180}\)

</li><li>
To convert a radian measure to degrees multiply the radian measure by \(\frac{360}{2\pi} = \frac{180}{\pi}\)

<div id="Angles and Their Measures-Arc Lengths and Areas of Sectors"><h2 id="Arc Lengths and Areas of Sectors" class="header"><a href="#Angles and Their Measures-Arc Lengths and Areas of Sectors">Arc Lengths and Areas of Sectors</a></h2></div>

<p>
In the following figure angle \(QOP\) has measure \(1\) radian and intercepts an arc of length \(r\). While angle \(ROT\) has measure \(\theta\) radians and intercepts an arc of length \(s\).  
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://albamr09.github.io/public/assets/arc_length.png" alt="Arch Length" style="width:250px;height:250px"> 
</p>

<p>
Since the lengths of the arcs are proportional to the measures of their central angles:
</p>

\begin{align}
\frac{s}{r} = \frac{\theta}{1}
\end{align}

\begin{align}
s = r\theta
\end{align}

<p>
A <span id="Angles and Their Measures-Arc Lengths and Areas of Sectors-sector"></span><strong id="sector">sector</strong> of a circle is the portion of the interior of a circle intercepted by a central angle.
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://albamr09.github.io/public/assets/circle_sector.png" alt="Circle Sector" style="width:250px;height:250px"> 
</p>

<p>
The interior of a circle can be thought of as a sector intercepted by a central angle of measure \(2\pi\) radians.
</p>

<p>
If a central angle for a sector has measure u radians, then the sector makes up the fraction \(\frac{\theta}{2\pi}\) of a complete circle. The area inside a circle with radius \(r\) is \(\mathcal{A} = \pi r^2\), Therefore,
the area of the sector is given by the product of the fraction \(\frac{\theta}{2\pi}\) and the total area:
</p>

\[
\mathcal{A} = \frac{\theta}{2\pi}(\pi r^2) = \frac{1}{1}r^2 \theta, \theta \text{ in radians}
\]

<div id="Angles and Their Measures-Linear and Angular Speed"><h2 id="Linear and Angular Speed" class="header"><a href="#Angles and Their Measures-Linear and Angular Speed">Linear and Angular Speed</a></h2></div>

<p>
Suppose that point \(P\) moves at a constant speed along a circle of radius \(r\) and center \(O\).
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://albamr09.github.io/public/assets/linear_angular_speed.png" alt="Linear and Angular Speed" style="width:270px;height:250px"> 
</p>

<p>
The measure of how fast the position of \(P\) is changing is called <span id="Angles and Their Measures-Linear and Angular Speed-linear speed"></span><strong id="linear speed">linear speed</strong>. If \(v\) represents linear speed, then:
</p>

\begin{align}
v = \frac{s}{t}
\end{align}

<p>
where \(s\) is the length of the arc traced by point \(P\) in time \(t\). (This formula is just a restatement of \(d = rt\) with \(s\) as distance, \(v\) as rate (speed), and \(t\) as time.)
</p>

<p>
As point \(P\) moves along the circle, ray \(OP\) rotates around the origin, so the speed at which the measure ofthe angle changes is called <span id="Angles and Their Measures-Linear and Angular Speed-angular speed"></span><strong id="angular speed">angular speed</strong>, \(\omega\) and is given by:
</p>

\begin{align}
\omega = \frac{\theta}{t}, \theta \text{ in radians}
\end{align}

<p>
where \(\theta\) is the measure of angle \(POB\).
</p>

<p>
To relate linear and angular speeds we use the result \(s = r\theta\), therefor:
</p>

\begin{align}
v = \frac{s}{t} = \frac{r\theta}{t} = r \frac{\theta}{t} = r \omega
\end{align}
