<p>
One way to solve a given equation analytically is to rewrite it as a series of simpler equivalent equations, each of which has the same solution set as the given one. Equivalent equations are obtained by using the properties of equality.
</p>

<div id="Linear Equations and Inequalities-Identities and Contradictions-Graphical Approaches to Solving Linear Equations"><h3 id="Graphical Approaches to Solving Linear Equations" class="header"><a href="#Linear Equations and Inequalities-Identities and Contradictions-Graphical Approaches to Solving Linear Equations">Graphical Approaches to Solving Linear Equations</a></h3></div>

<p>
In general, if \(f\) and \(g\) are linear functions, then their graphs are lines that intersect at a single point, no point, or infinitely many points, as illustrated in FIGURE 67.

<p>
An inequality says that one expression is greater than, greater than or equal to, less than, or less than or equal to another.
</p>

<p>
Two inequalities with the same solution set are <span id="Linear Equations and Inequalities-Solving Linear Inequalities in One Variable-equivalent inequalities"></span><strong id="equivalent inequalities">equivalent inequalities</strong>. Inequalities are solved using the properties of inequality:
</p>

<p>
For real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):
</p>

<ul>
<li>
\(a &lt; b\) and \(a + c &lt; b + c\) are equivalent

</li><li>
If \(c &gt; 0\), then \(a &lt; b\) and \(ac &lt; bc\) are equivalent

</li><li>
If \(c &lt; 0\), then \(a &lt; b\) and \(ac &gt; bc\) are equivalent

</li></ul>
<p>
Similar properties exist for \(&gt;, \leq\) and \(\geq\).
</p>

<p>
A linear inequality in the variable \(x\) is an inequality that can be written in one of the following forms, where \(a \neq 0\).
</p>

\begin{align}
ax + b &gt; 0
\end{align}

\begin{align}
ax + b &lt; 0
\end{align}

\begin{align}
ax + b \geq 0
\end{align}

\begin{align}
ax + b \leq 0
\end{align}

<p>
The solution set of a linear inequality is typically an interval of the real number line and can be expressed in interval notation.
