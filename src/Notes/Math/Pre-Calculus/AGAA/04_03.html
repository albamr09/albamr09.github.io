A <span id="Rational Equations, Inequalities, Models and Applications-Solving Rational Equations and Inequalities-rational equation"></span><strong id="rational equation">rational equation</strong> (or rational inequality) is an equation (or inequality) with at least one term having a variable expression in a denominator or at least one term having a variable expression raised to a negative integer power.

Determine all values for which the rational equation has undefined expressions.

</li><li>
To clear fractions, multiply each side of the equation by the least common denominator of all rational expressions in the equation.

</li><li>
Solve the resulting equation.

<ol>
<li>
Rewrite the inequality, if necessary, so that \(0\) is on one side and there is a single rational expression on the other side.

</li><li>
Determine the values that will cause either the numerator or the denominator of the rational expression to equal \(0\). These values determine the intervals on the number line to consider.

</li><li>
Use a test value from each interval to determine which intervals form the solution set.

When two quantities vary inversely, an increase in one quantity results in a decrease in the other.

Let \(x\) and \(y\) denote two quantities and \(n\) be a positive number.
