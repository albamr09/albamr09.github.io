If we replace a in <a href="02_07.html#Derivatives">Equation 1</a> by a variable \(x\), we obtain:
</p>

\begin{align}
f'(x) = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}
\end{align}

<p>
So we can regard \(f'\) as a new function, called the <span id="The Derivative as a Function-derivative of"></span><strong id="derivative of">derivative of</strong> \(f\), which can be interpreted geometrically as the slope of the tangent line to the graph of \(f\) at the point \((x, f(x))\). This function is called the derivative of \(f\) because it has been derived from \(f\) by the limiting operation above. The domain of \(f'\) is the set \(\{x | f'(x) \text{exists}\}\) and may be smaller than the domain of \(f\).

<p>
Some common alternative notations for th derive are as follows:
</p>

\begin{align}
f'(x) = y' = \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{df}{fx} = \frac{d}{dx} f(x) = Df(x) = D_x f(x)
\end{align}

<p>
The symbols \(D\) and \(\frac{d}{dx}\) are called <span id="The Derivative as a Function-Other Notations-differentiation operators"></span><strong id="differentiation operators">differentiation operators</strong> because they indicate the operation of <span id="The Derivative as a Function-Other Notations-differentiation"></span><strong id="differentiation">differentiation</strong>. The symbol \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) was introduced by Leibniz as a synonim for \(f'(x)\). We can rewrite the definition of the derivative in Leibniz notation in the form:
</p>

\begin{align}
\frac{dy}{dx} = \lim_{\Delta x \rightarrow 0} \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}
\end{align}

<p>
To indicate the value of a derivative \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) in Leibniz notation at a specific number \(a\), we use the notation:
</p>

\begin{align}
\eval{\frac{dy}{dx}}{x=a}
\end{align}

<div id="The Derivative as a Function-Theorems"><h2 id="Theorems" class="header"><a href="#The Derivative as a Function-Theorems">Theorems</a></h2></div>

<p>
A function \(f\) is <span id="The Derivative as a Function-Theorems-differentiable at"></span><strong id="differentiable at">differentiable at</strong> \(a\) if \(f'(a)\) exists. It is <span id="The Derivative as a Function-Theorems-differentiable on an open interval"></span><strong id="differentiable on an open interval">differentiable on an open interval</strong> \((a, b)\) if it is differentiable at every number in the interval.
</p>

<p>
If \(f\) is differentiable \(a\), then \(f\) is continuous at \(a\).
</p>

<p>
<span id="The Derivative as a Function-Theorems-Proof"></span><strong id="Proof">Proof</strong>:
</p>

<p>
We assume that \(f\) is differentiable at \(a\), so we have to prove that \(f\) is continuous at \(a\), that is we have to show:
</p>

\begin{align}
\lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = f(a)
\end{align}

<p>
We will do this by showing that the difference \(f(x) - f(a)\)  approaches \(0\). Then, multiplying and dividing \(f(x) - f(a)\) by \(x - a\)
</p>

\begin{align}
f(x) - f(a) = \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a} (x - a)
\end{align}

<p>
By the <a href="Limit Laws.html">Limit Laws</a>:
</p>

\begin{align}
\lim_{x \rightarrow a} [f(x) - f(a)] = \lim_{x \rightarrow a} \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a} (x - a)
\end{align}

\begin{align}
= \lim_{x \rightarrow a} \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a} \cdot \lim_{x \rightarrow a} (x - a)
\end{align}

<p>
Because we know that \(f\) is differentiable at \(a\), then:
</p>

\begin{align}
f'(a) = \lim_{x \rightarrow a} \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a}
\end{align}

<p>
exists, such that:
</p>

\begin{align}
= f'(a) \cdot (a - a)= f'(a) \cdot 0 = 0
\end{align}

<p>
Now we use this result to prove that \(f\) is continuous:
</p>

\begin{align}
\lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = \lim_{x \rightarrow a} [f(a) + (f(x) - f(a))]
\end{align}

\begin{align}
= \lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(a) + \lim_{x \rightarrow a} [f(x) - f(a)]
\end{align}

<p>
From our previous lemma we know that \(\lim_{x \rightarrow a} [f(x) - f(a)] = 0\). Then:
</p>

\begin{align}
= \lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(a) + 0 = f(a)
\end{align}

<p>
Therefore \(f\) is continuous at \(a\).

<p>
We consider three scenarios:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
If the graph of a function \(f\) has a corner or a kink in it, then the graph of \(f\) has no tangent at this point and \(f\) is not differentiable there.

</li><li>
By the contrapositive of "If \(f\) is differentiable at \(a\), then \(f\) is continuous at \(a\)" we know that if \(f\) is not continuous at \(a\) then \(f\) is not differentiable at \(a\).

</li><li>
If the curve given by \(f\) has a <span id="The Derivative as a Function-How Can a Function Fail To Be Differentiable-vertical tangent line"></span><strong id="vertical tangent line">vertical tangent line</strong> when \(x = a\), \(f\) is continuous at \(a\) and \(\lim_{x \rightarrow a} |f'(x)| = \infty\) then \(f\) is not differentiable at \(a\).

</li></ul>
<p>
Figure 7 illustrates the three possibilities:

<div id="The Derivative as a Function-Higher Derivatives"><h2 id="Higher Derivatives" class="header"><a href="#The Derivative as a Function-Higher Derivatives">Higher Derivatives</a></h2></div>

<p>
If \(f\) is a differentiable function, then its derivative \(f'\) is also a function, so \(f'\) may have a derivative of its own, denoted by \((f')' = f''\), called the <span id="The Derivative as a Function-Higher Derivatives-second derivative"></span><strong id="second derivative">second derivative</strong> of \(f\). Using Leibniz notation:
</p>

\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dx} \left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right) = \frac{d^2y}{dx^2}
\end{align}

<p>
In general, we can interpret a second derivative as a rate of change of a rate of change. The most familiar example of this is acceleration. If \(s(t)\) is the position function, we know that its first derivative represents the velocity \(v(t)\):
</p>

\begin{align}
v(t) = s'(t) = \frac{ds}{dt}
\end{align}

<p>
The instantaneous rate of change of velocity with respect to time is called the <span id="The Derivative as a Function-Higher Derivatives-acceleration"></span><strong id="acceleration">acceleration</strong> \(a(t)\). Thus the acceleration function is the derivative of the velocity function, that is the second derivative of the position function:
</p>

\begin{align}
a(t) = v'(t) = s''(t)
\end{align}

<p>
or in Leibniz notation:
</p>

\begin{align}
a = \frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{d^2s}{dt^2}
\end{align}

<p>
The <span id="The Derivative as a Function-Higher Derivatives-third derivative"></span><strong id="third derivative">third derivative</strong> \(f'''\) is the derivative of the second derivative \(f''' = (f'')'\). It can be interpreted as the slope of the curve \(y = f''(x)\) or as the rante of change of \(f''(x)\). Alternative notations are:
</p>

\begin{align}
y''' = f'''(x) = \frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} \right) = \frac{d^3y}{dx^3}
\end{align}

<p>
We can also interpret the third derivative physically. Given the position function \(s(t)\) its third derivative is the derivative of the acceleration function and is called the <span id="The Derivative as a Function-Higher Derivatives-jerk"></span><strong id="jerk">jerk</strong>:
</p>

\begin{align}
j = \frac{da}{dt} = \frac{d^3s}{dt^3}
\end{align}

<p>
It represents the rate of change of acceleration. It is named like so because a large jerk means a sudden change in acceleration, which causes an abrupt movement.
</p>

<p>
In general, the \(n\)th derivative of \(f\) is denoted by \(f^{(n)}\) and is obtained from \(f\) by differentiating \(n\) times. If \(y = f(x)\), we write:
</p>

\begin{align}
y^{(n)} = f^{(n)}(x) = \frac{d^n y}{dx^n}
\end{align}
</div>
