- **Use intention revealing names**: the name of a variable, function or class should answer why it exists, what it does and how it is used.

Let's avoid:

```java
List<int> list1;
```

- **Make meaningful distinctions**: if variable names are different then they must mean something different, and that difference has to be easily understood.

Let's avoid:

```java
char[] a1;
char[] a2;
```

- **Use pronounceable names**: use common words for names, instead of gibberish.

Let's avoid:

```java
class DtaRcRd102 {
private Date genymdhms;
}
```

- **Use searchable names**: if a variable is used on several places on your code it should be easy to seach, so avoid numbers and single letter variables.
- **Class names**: should be nouns or noun-like words.
- **Method names**: should have verb or verb phrases as names.
- **Pick one word per concept**: avoid having different namings for something that is fundamentally the same. For example, avoid having `fetch`, `retrieve` and `get` as different method names that do the "same".
- **Use solution domain names**: use algorithm names, pattern names, math names and so forth.
- **Use problem domain names**: if no solution domain name is suitable, go ahead and use the name from the problem domain.
- **Add meaninful context**: few names are meaningul in and of themselves, so it is always helpful when they are declared under well named classes, methods, namespaces, etc.
