# Constructing a parametrized prior distribution

## Example

Suppose the aim is to estimate $\theta$, the probability of tumor in a population of female laboratory rats of type "F344" that receive a zero dose of the drug (control group).

It is natural to assume a [binomial model](#T2.&#32;Modelos&#32;Jer√°rquicos-Appendix) for the number of tumors, given $\theta$. For convenience, we select a prior distribution for $\theta$ from the conjugate family, $\theta \sim Beta(\alpha, \beta)$

## Analysis with a fixed prior distribution

From historical data, suppose we knew that the tumor probabilities $\theta$ among groups of female lab rats of type "F344" follow an approximate beta distribution, with known mean and standard deviation.

The use of a fixed prior distribution from historical data allows for the construction of a parameterized prior distribution, which in turn influences the posterior distribution for the current experiment.

Then, assuming a $Beta(\alpha, \beta)$ prior distribution for $\theta$ yields a $Beta(\alpha + 4, \beta + 10)$ posterior distribution for $\theta$.

## Approximate estimate of the population distribution using the historical data

Contrary to last section, typically, the mean and standard deviation of underlying tumor risks are not available, rather historical data is available from previous experiments on similar conditions.

In the $j$th historical experiment, let the number of rats with tumors be $y_j$ and the total number of rats be $n_j$. We model the $y_j$'s (probability that $p$ rats have tumor given a total of $n$ rats) as independent binomial data, given sample sizes $n_j$ and study-specific means $\theta_j$.

We can display the hierarchical model schematically as follows:

The observed sample mean and standard deviation of the 70 values $y_j$, $n_j$ are $0.136$ and $0.103$. If we set the mean and standard deviation of the population distribution to these values we can solve for $\theta$ and $\beta$.

The resulting estimate for $(\alpha, \beta)$ is $(1.4, 8.6)$. **This is not a Bayesian calculation because it is not based on any specified full probability model.**

## Appendix

- **Binomial model**: In probability theory and statistics, the binomial distribution with parameters $n$ and $p$ is the discrete probability distribution of the number of successes in a sequence of $n$ independent experiments ([Binomial Distribution](https://en.mdpedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution))
