## First Year

### First semester

- [x] **Dicrete Maths**
  - [x] Discrete Mathematics with Applications, 2nd edition by Susanna S. Epp
  - [ ] Discrete Mathematics Structures, 4th edition by Kolman, Busby and Ross
- [x] **Proof writing** _(very advanced, do not expect to master anything in these books)_
  - [x] Mathematical Proofs: A transition to advanced mathematics by Gary Chartrand et. al _(This one is better than the next one)_
  - [ ] An introduction to Abstract Mathematics by Robert J. Bond and Wiliam J. Keane

### Second semester

- [x] **Pre-algebra** _(refresh really basic math)_
  - [ ] AGS Pre-Algebra _(has solutions)_
  - [ ] Fearon's Pre-Algebra _(this one is better)_
- [x] **College Algebra** _(after the pre-algebra one, if the pre-algebra books are too easy skip onto these ones)_
  - [x] College Algebra by Kaufmann _(more begginer friendly)_
  - [ ] College Algebra by Blitzer

## Second Year

### First semester

- [ ] **Pre-calculus** _(once you are done with college algebra. If you know some basic algebra you can skip the college algebra and start in this section)_
  - [O] A Graphical Approach to Algebra and Trigonometry by Hornsby, Lial, and Rockswold. 6th edition _(Get the instructor's edition)_

### Second semester

- [ ] **Calculus**
  - [O] Calculus by James Stewart, 5th edition _(Very famous book, to learn basic calculus. It has a lot of problems. Used to teach calculus I, II and III)_
  - [ ] Calculus by Michael Spivak, 3rd edition _(It has less material but it is more advanced)_

## Third Year

### First semester

- [ ] **Differential equations**
  - [O] A First Course in Differential Equations by Zill
  - [ ] Ordinary Differential Equations with Applications by Andrews _(It is easier, good for beginners)_
- [ ] **Linear Algebra** _(try to learn as much as possible)_
  - [O] Elementary Linear Algebra by Howard Anton _(Beginner friendly, with exercises)_
  - [O] Linear Algebra by Friedgber, Insel, and Spence _(It is harder and more difficult to read. It is proof based)_

### Second semester

- [ ] **Statistics**
  - [O] Mathematical Statistics by Wackerly, Mendenhall, and Scheaffer
  - [O] A First Course in Probability by Ross
- [ ] **Complex analysis** _(Calculus with complex numbers. Both are pretty much the same, very good beginner books)_
  - [ ] Fundamentals of Complex Analysis by Saff and Snider, 3rd edition
  - [O] Complex Variables and Applications by Brown and Churchill, 7th edition

## Fourth Year

### First semester

- [ ] **Real analysis** _(one of the hardest subjects)_
  - [ ] Analysis 1 and Analysis 2 by Terrance Tao _(Easier to read, but the other two are standard)_
  - [ ] Advanced Calculus by Fitzpatrick
  - [ ] Principles of Mathematical Analysis by Rudin
  - [ ] Elements ofAnalysis by Ross _(Expends a lot of time for proofs)_
- [ ] **Abstract algebra** _(study of groups, rings and fields. Very proof based)_
  - [ ] Abstract Algebra by Saracino _(Very good for beginners)_
  - [ ] Contemporary Abstract Algebra by Gallian _(Also good for beginners)_

### Second semester

- [ ] **Topology** _(optional)_
  - [ ] Introduction to Topology by Gamelin and Greene _(It has full solutions for all of the problems)_
- [ ] **Combinatorics** _(optional)_
  - [ ] Applied Combinatorics by Tucker
- [ ] **Naive set theory** _(optional)_
  - [ ] Naive Set Theory by Halmos
- [ ] **Functional analysis** _(optional)_
  - [ ] Functional Analysis by Kreyszig
- [ ] **Graph Theory** _(optional)_
  - [ ] Graph Theory by Gould
