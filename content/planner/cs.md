> [!TIP] **Finished!**

### Notes

- [x] Work through at least the first three chapters of SICP and doing the exercises. For additional practice, work through a set of small programming problems like those on [exercism](https://www.exercism.io).

### Additional

Same course but with python instead of Scheme (Stk)

- Books: [Composing Programs](https://composingprograms.com/)
