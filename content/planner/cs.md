### Notes

We recommend working through at least the first three chapters of SICP and doing the exercises. For additional practice, work through a set of small programming problems like those on [exercism](https://www.exercism.io).

### Alternatives

Same course but with python instead of Scheme (Stk)

- Books: [Composing Programs](https://composingprograms.com/)
- Lectures: 61A taught by John DeNero at Berkley.

### Resources

#### Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective

Most courses go from chapter 1 to 6. Do [this course](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~213/)

#### Nand2Tetris

Each chapter involves building a small piece of the overall system, from writing elementary logic gates in HDL, through a CPU and assembler, all the way to an application the size of a Tetris game.

[The Elements of Computing Systems (Nand2Tetris)](http://www.nand2tetris.org/)
