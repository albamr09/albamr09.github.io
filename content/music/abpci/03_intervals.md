## Melodic Interval

Distances between tones are measured in **intervals**, called $2$nds, $3$rds, $4$ths, $5$ths, etc.

Notes playes separately make a **melody**, and we call the intervals between these notes **melodic intervals**.

## Harmonic Interval

Notes played together make **harmony**. We call the intervals between these notes **harmonic intervals**.

## 6ths

When you skip 4 white keys then the interval is a 6th.
