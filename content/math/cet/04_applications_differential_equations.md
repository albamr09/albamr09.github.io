## Maximum and Minimum Values

Some of the most important applications of differential calculus are **optimization problems**, in which we are required to find the optimal (best) way of doing something.

### Absolute and Local Extreme Values

> [!TIP] **Absolute Values**
>
> Let $c$ bea a number in the domain $D$ of a function $f$. Then $f(c)$ is the
>
> - **absolute maximum** value of $f$ on $D$ if $f(c) \geq f(x)$ for all $x$ in $D$
> - **absolute minimum** value of $f$ on $D$ if $f(c) \leq f(x)$ for all $x$ in $D$

An absolute maximum or minimum is sometimes called a **global maximum or minimum**. The maximum and minimum values of $f$ are called **extreme values** of $f$.
