## Simplifying Rational Expressions

> [!NOTE] **Property 4.1**
>
> $$ \frac{-a}{b} = \frac{a}{-b} = -\frac{a}{b}, \text{ where } b \neq 0 $$
>
> $$ \frac{-a}{-b} = \frac{a}{b}, \text{ where } b \neq 0 $$

> [!NOTE] **Property 4.2 Fundamental Principle of Fractions**
>
> If \(b\) and \(k\) are nonzero integers and \(a\) is any integer, then
>
> $$ \frac{a \cdot k}{b \cdot k} = \frac{a}{b} $$
