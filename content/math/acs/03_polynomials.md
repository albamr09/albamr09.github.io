## Polynomials: Sums and Differences

A **term** is an indicated product and may contain any number of factors. The variables in a term are called **literal factors**, and the numerical factor is called the **numerical coefficient**.

The **degree of a monomial** is the sum of the exponents of the literal factors.

> [!TIP] **Definition**
>
> A **polynomial** is a monomial or a finite sum (or difference) of monomials.

The **degree of a polynomial** is the degree of the term with the highest degree

## Products and Quotients of Monomials

> [!NOTE] **Property 3.1 Product of the Same Base with Integer Exponents**
>
> If \(b\) is any real number, and \(n\) and \(m\) are positive integers, then
>
> $$ b^n \cdot b^m = b^{m + n} $$

> [!NOTE] **Property 3.3 Power Raised to a Power**
>
> If \(b\) is any real number, and \(n\) and \(m\) are positive integers, then
>
> $$ (b^n)^m = b^{mn} $$

> [!NOTE] **Property 3.3 Power of a Product**
>
> If \(b\) is any real number, and \(n\) is a positive integer, then
>
> $$ (ab)^n = a^n b^n $$

### Dividing Monomials

> [!NOTE] **Property 3.4 Quotient of Same Base with Integer Exponents**
>
> If \(b\) is any nonzero real number, and \(n\) and \(m\) are positive integers, then
>
> $$ \frac{b^n}{b^m} = b^{n - m}, \text{ when n > m } $$
>
> $$ \frac{b^n}{b^m} = 1, \text{ when n = m } $$

## Factoring: Greatest Common Factor and Common Binomial Factor

> [!TIP] **Definition**
>
> If a positive integer greater than \(1\) has no factors that are positive integers other than itself and \(1\), then it is called a **prime number**.

> [!TIP] **Definition**
>
> A positive integer greater than \(1\) that is not a prime number is called a **composite number**.

The indicated product form that contains only prime factors is called the **prime factorization form of a number**.

A polynomial with integral coefficients is in completely factored form if:

1. It is expressed as a product of polynomials with integral coefficients
2. No polynomial, other than a monomial, within the factored form can be further factored into polynomials with integral coefficients.

> [!NOTE] **Property 3.5**
>
> Let \(a\) and \(b\) be real numbers. Then:
>
> \(ab = 0\) is and only if \(a = 0\) or \(b = 0\)

## Factoring: Difference of Two Squares and Sum or Difference of Two Cubes

> [!NOTE] **Identity Difference of Two Squares**
>
> $$ a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b) $$

We say that a polynomial is a **prime polynomial** if it is not factorable using integers.

### Factoring the Sum and Difference of Two Cubes

> [!NOTE] **Identity Sum and Difference of Two Cubes**
>
> $$ a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2) $$
>
> $$ a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2) $$
