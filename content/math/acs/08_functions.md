## Concept of a Function

> [!NOTE] **Vertical Line Test**
>
> If each vertical line intersects a graph in no more than one point, then the graph represents a function.

### Finding the Difference Quotient

The quotient \(\frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h}\) is often called a **difference quotient**.

## Linear Functions and Applications

Any function that can be written in the form

$$
f(x) = ax + b
$$

where \(a\) and \(b\) are real numbers, is called a **linear function**.

The linear function \(f(x) = x\) is often called the **identity function**. Any linear function of the form \(f(x) = ax + b\), where \(a = 0\), is called a **constant function**.

A property of plane geometry states that if two or more lines are perpendicular to the same line, then they are parallel lines.
