## Real-Valued Functions of a Real Variable and Their Graphs

A **Cartesian plane** or **two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system** is a pictorial representation of $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$, obtained by setting up a one-to-one correspondence between ordered pairs of real numbers and points in a Euclidean plane. To obtain it, two perpendicular lines, called the **horizontal and vertical axes**, are drawn in the plane. Their point of intersection is called the origin, and a unit of distance is chosen for each axis.

An ordered pair $(x, y)$ of real numbers corresponds to the point $P$ that lies $|x|$ units to the right or left of the vertical axis and $|y|$ units above or below the horizontal axis.

> [!NOTE] **Real-Valued Function of a Real Variable**
>
> A real-valued function of a real variable is a function from one set of real numbers to another. If $f$ is a real-valued function of a real variable, then for each real number $x$ in the domain of $f$ there is a unique corresponding real number $f(x)$.

> [!NOTE] **Graph of a Real Function**
>
> The graph of $f$ is the set of all points $(x, y)$ in the Cartesian coordinate plane with the property that $x$ is in the domain of $f$ and $y = f(x)$.

The example of the graph of a function $f$ is shown in the following figure:

### Power Functions

A function that sends a real number $x$ to a particular power, $x^a$, is called a power function.

> [!NOTE] **Power Function**
>
> Let $a$ be any nonnegative real number. Define $p_a$, the **power function** with exponent $a$, as follows:
>
> $$p_a(x) = x^a, \text{ for each nonnegative real number } x$$

### Increasing and Decreasing Function

> [!NOTE] **Increasing Function**
>
> Let $f$ be a real-valued function defined on a set of real numbers, and suppose the domain of $f$ contains a set $S$. We say that $f$ is **increasing on the set $S$** if, and only if,
>
> $$\text{for all real numbers } x_1 \text{ and } x_2 \text{ in } S, \text{ if } x_1 < x_2 \text{ then } f(x_1) < f(x_2)$$

> [!NOTE] **Decreasing Function**
>
> Let $f$ be a real-valued function defined on a set of real numbers, and suppose the domain of $f$ contains a set $S$. We say that $f$ is **decreasing on the set $S$** if, and only if,
>
> $$\text{for all real numbers } x_1 \text{ and } x_2 \text{ in } S, \text{ if } x_1 < x_2 \text{ then } f(x_1) > f(x_2)$$

We say that $f$ is an increasing (or decreasing) function if, and only if, $f$ is increasing (or decreasing) on its entire domain.

The following image shows examples of increasing (left) and decreasing (right) functions:
