## Logic Form and Logic Equivalence

An **argument** is a sequence of **statements** aimed at demonstrating the truth of an assertion. The assertion at the end of the sequence is called the **conclusion**, and the preceding statements are called **premises**. The following shows an example of an argument:

It common form is as follows

### Statements

> [!TIP] **Statement**
>
> A **statement** (or **proposition**) is a sentence that is true or false but not both

### Compound Statements

We now introduce three symbols that are used to build more complicated logical expressions out of simpler ones.

1. The symbol $\sim$ denotes not
2. The symbol $\wedge$ denotes and
3. The symbol $\vee$ denotes or

Its order of preference is:

1. The not operation $\sim$
2. The $\wedge$ and $\vee$ operation are considered equal.

### Truth Values

> [!TIP] **Negation**
>
> If $p$ is a statement variable, the negation of $p$ is "not $p$" or "It is not the case that $p$" and is denoted $\sim p$. It has opposite truth value from $p$.
