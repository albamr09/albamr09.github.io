## Introduction to Probability

> [!TIP] **Random Process**
>
> To say that a process is **random** means that when it takes place, one outcome from some set of outcomes is sure to occur, but it is impossible to predict with certainty which outcome that will be.

> [!NOTE] **Sample Space**
>
> A **sample space** is the set of all possible outcomes of a random process or experiment. An **event** is a subset of a sample space.

In the case where an experiment has finitely many outcomes and all outcomes are equally likely to occur, the probability of an event (set of outcomes) is just the ratio of the number of outcomes in the event to the total number of outcomes.

> [!TIP] **Equally Likely Probability Formula**
>
> If $S$ is a finite sample space in which all outcomes are equally likely and $E$ is an event in $S$, then the **probability of $E$**, denoted $P(E)$, is
>
> $$P(E) = \frac{\text{ the number of outcomes in } E}{\text{the total number of outcomes in } S}$$

### Counting the Elements of a List

> [!NOTE] **The Number of Elements in a List**

> If $m$ and $n$ are integers and $m \leq n$, then there are $n - m + 1$ integers from $m$ to $n$ inclusive.
